prompt:
Create a Python function `_coefficients_no_filter` that computes the first \(2d+1\) Fourier coefficients for a \(2\pi\)-periodic function, serving as a helper to compute these coefficients without filtering. The function takes a callable `f`, an integer or tuple `degree` representing the maximum frequency, and a boolean `use_broadcasting` to decide whether to use broadcasting for simultaneous function evaluations. It returns a NumPy array of complex numbers containing the Fourier coefficients up to the specified degree. The function should efficiently handle multi-dimensional inputs and leverage broadcasting for performance optimization.
