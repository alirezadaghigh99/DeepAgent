prompt:
Define a Python function called mesh_normal_consistency that computes the normal consistency of each mesh in a batch of meshes. The function takes a Meshes object as input and returns the average normal consistency across the batch. If the input meshes contain no meshes or all empty meshes, the function returns 0. The normal consistency is calculated based on the angles between the normals of neighboring faces in the meshes. The function handles cases where multiple faces share an edge and efficiently finds the vertices associated with each edge.
