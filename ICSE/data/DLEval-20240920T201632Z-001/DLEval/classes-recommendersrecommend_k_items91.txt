prompt:
Generate a Python function `recommend_k_items` for the class `RBM` that returns the top `k` items ordered by a relevancy score for a given input user/affinity matrix `x`. The function should sample new ratings and their associated probabilities from the learned joint distribution using `eval_out`. It then computes a recommendation score. If `remove_seen` is `True`, the function should exclude items already seen by the user The function returns a sparse matrix containing the top `k` elements ordered by their score.

```python
class RBM:
    def __init__(self, possible_ratings, visible_units, hidden_units=500, keep_prob=0.7, init_stdv=0.1, learning_rate=0.004, minibatch_size=100, training_epoch=20, display_epoch=10, sampling_protocol=[50, 70, 80, 90, 100], debug=False, with_metrics=False, seed=42):
        self.vu = None  # visible units input placeholder
        self.sess = None  # TensorFlow session
        self.seen_mask = None  # mask for seen items
        pass

    def eval_out(self):
        # Outputs the sampled visible units and the conditional probability of the visible units
        pass

    def recommend_k_items(self, x, top_k=10, remove_seen=True):
        # Implement the function as described in the prompt
