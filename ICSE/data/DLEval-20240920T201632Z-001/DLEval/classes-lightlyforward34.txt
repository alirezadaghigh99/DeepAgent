Write a Python function `forward` for the class `SwaVLoss` that computes the SwaV loss using high-resolution and low-resolution outputs. The function should handle optional queue outputs and calculate the final loss by averaging sublosses across different views. The function should return the SwaV loss as a `torch.Tensor`. Here is the class structure:

```python
class SwaVLoss(nn.Module):
    def subloss(self, z: torch.Tensor, q: torch.Tensor):
        # Returns the cross entropy between predictions z and codes q as a tensor.
    def forward(self, high_resolution_outputs: List[torch.Tensor], low_resolution_outputs: List[torch.Tensor], queue_outputs: List[torch.Tensor] = None) -> torch.Tensor:
```
