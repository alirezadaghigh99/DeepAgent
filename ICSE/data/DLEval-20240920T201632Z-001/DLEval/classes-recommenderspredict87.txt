data: Inference

prompt:
Generate a Python function `predict` for the class `RBM` that returns the inferred ratings for a given input user/affinity matrix `x`. The function should use the model to sample new ratings from the learned joint distribution. The input `x` must have the same number of columns as the training data but can have an arbitrary number of rows (users). The function should return a matrix of inferred ratings (`vp`) and the elapsed time for prediction. It achieves this by using the `eval_out` method to evaluate the ratings and their associated probabilities, then running the TensorFlow session (`self.sess`) to obtain the final predicted ratings.

Class structure:

```python
class RBM:
    def __init__(self, possible_ratings, visible_units, hidden_units=500, keep_prob=0.7, init_stdv=0.1, learning_rate=0.004, minibatch_size=100, training_epoch=20, display_epoch=10, sampling_protocol=[50, 70, 80, 90, 100], debug=False, with_metrics=False, seed=42):
        self.vu = None  # visible units input placeholder
        self.sess = None  # TensorFlow session
        pass

    def eval_out(self):
        # Outputs the sampled visible units and the conditional probability of the visible units
        pass

    def predict(self, x):
        # Implement the function as described in the prompt
```
