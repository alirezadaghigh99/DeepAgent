stage: Model Construction
task: 
data: Image

prompt:
Create a function `motion_from_essential_choose_solution` that recovers the relative camera rotation and translation from an estimated essential matrix `E_mat`. The function checks corresponding points in two images using the camera matrices `K1` and `K2` and returns the best solution along with the triangulated 3D points. Input tensors include the essential matrix (`E_mat`), camera matrices (`K1`, `K2`), and point sets (`x1`, `x2`). An optional `mask` can exclude points from choosing the best solution. The function returns a tuple containing the rotation matrix, translation vector, and 3D points. Errors are raised for incorrect input shapes, and batch dimensions are handled appropriately.
