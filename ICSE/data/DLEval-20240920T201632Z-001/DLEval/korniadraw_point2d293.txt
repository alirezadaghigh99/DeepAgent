data: Image

prompt:
Write a Python function `draw_point2d` that sets specified `[x, y]` coordinates in an image tensor to a given color. The image can be either grayscale `(H, W)` or multi-channel `(C, H, W)`, and the color tensor must match the image's channels. The function should return the modified image with the points colored.
