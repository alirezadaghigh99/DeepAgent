prompt:
Generate a Python function called filter2d that Convolve a tensor with a 2d kernel.

    The function applies a given kernel to a tensor. The kernel is applied
    independently at each depth channel of the tensor. Before applying the
    kernel, the function applies padding according to the specified mode so
    that the output remains in the same shape.

    Args:
        input: the input tensor with shape of
          :math:`(B, C, H, W)`.
        kernel: the kernel to be convolved with the input
          tensor. The kernel shape must be :math:`(1, kH, kW)` or :math:`(B, kH, kW)`.
        border_type: the padding mode to be applied before convolving.
          The expected modes are: ``'constant'``, ``'reflect'``,
          ``'replicate'`` or ``'circular'``.
        normalized: If True, kernel will be L1 normalized.
        padding: This defines the type of padding.
          2 modes available ``'same'`` or ``'valid'``.
        behaviour: defines the convolution mode -- correlation (default), using pytorch conv2d,
        or true convolution (kernel is flipped). 2 modes available ``'corr'`` or ``'conv'``.


    Return:
        Tensor: the convolved tensor of same size and numbers of channels
        as the input with shape :math:`(B, C, H, W)`.
