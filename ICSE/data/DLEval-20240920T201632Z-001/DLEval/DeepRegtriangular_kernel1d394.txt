    Return a the 1D triangular kernel for LocalNormalizedCrossCorrelation.

    Assume kernel_size is odd, it will be a smoothed from
    a kernel which center part is zero.
    Then length of the ones will be around half kernel_size.
    The weight scale of the kernel does not matter as LNCC will normalize it.
