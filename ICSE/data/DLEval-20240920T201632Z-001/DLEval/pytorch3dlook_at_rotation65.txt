prompt:
Generate a Python function called look_at_rotation that takes in the camera_position, at, up vectors, and device type as inputs. The function returns a batched rotation matrix R representing the transformation from world coordinates to view coordinates. The camera_position, at, and up vectors can be 3-element tuples/lists or torch tensors of shape (1, 3) or (N, 3), where N is the batch size. The function normalizes the input vectors, calculates the x, y, and z axes, and handles cases where the x-axis is close to zero. Finally, it concatenates the axes to form the rotation matrix R and returns the transposed matrix.
