prompt:
Generate a Python function called corresponding_points_alignment that Finds a similarity transformation (rotation `R`, translation `T`
    and optionally scale `s`)  between two given sets of corresponding
    `d`-dimensional points `X` and `Y` such that:

    `s[i] X[i] R[i] + T[i] = Y[i]`,

    for all batch indexes `i` in the least squares sense.

    The algorithm is also known as Umeyama [1].

    Args:
        **X**: Batch of `d`-dimensional points of shape `(minibatch, num_point, d)`
            or a `Pointclouds` object.
        **Y**: Batch of `d`-dimensional points of shape `(minibatch, num_point, d)`
            or a `Pointclouds` object.
        **weights**: Batch of non-negative weights of
            shape `(minibatch, num_point)` or list of `minibatch` 1-dimensional
            tensors that may have different shapes; in that case, the length of
            i-th tensor should be equal to the number of points in X_i and Y_i.
            Passing `None` means uniform weights.
        **estimate_scale**: If `True`, also estimates a scaling component `s`
            of the transformation. Otherwise assumes an identity
            scale and returns a tensor of ones.
        **allow_reflection**: If `True`, allows the algorithm to return `R`
            which is orthonormal but has determinant==-1.
        **eps**: A scalar for clamping to avoid dividing by zero. Active for the
            code that estimates the output scale `s`.

    Returns:
        3-element named tuple `SimilarityTransform` containing
        - **R**: Batch of orthonormal matrices of shape `(minibatch, d, d)`.
        - **T**: Batch of translations of shape `(minibatch, d)`.
        - **s**: batch of scaling factors of shape `(minibatch, )`.if (Xt.shape != Yt.shape) or (num_points != num_points_Y).any():
        raise ValueError(
            "Point sets X and Y have to have the same \
            number of batches, points and dimensions."
        )if Xt.shape[:2] != weights.shape:
            raise ValueError("weights should have the same first two dimensions as X.")
