prompt:
Generate the `_compute_padded` function for the following class to compute the padded version of the points, normals, and features from their list representations. The function should take an optional argument `refresh` which, when set to True, forces the recalculation of the padded representations. Ensure the function updates `_points_padded`, `_normals_padded`, and `_features_padded` attributes of the class.

```python
class Pointclouds:
    def _compute_padded(self, refresh: bool = False):
        pass
```
