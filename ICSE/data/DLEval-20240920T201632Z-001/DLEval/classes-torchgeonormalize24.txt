prompt:

Generate a Python method `_normalize` for the `RCF` class that performs ZCA whitening on a set of input patches. The method should normalize the patches by removing the mean, normalizing the patches to have unit norms, and then applying ZCA whitening. The method should take as input a NumPy array `patches` of shape `(N, C, H, W)` and return a normalized NumPy array of the same shape. Additional parameters should include `min_divisor` to prevent division by zero and `zca_bias` to add a small bias during whitening. The method should follow the ZCA whitening steps as specified in the `mosaiks-paper` repository.

Class structure:

```python
class RCF:
    def __init__(self, in_channels: int = 4, features: int = 16, kernel_size: int = 3, bias: float = -1.0, seed: int | None = None, mode: str = 'gaussian', dataset: NonGeoDataset | None = None):
        self.weights = ...
        self.biases = ...
        pass

    def _normalize(self, patches: np.typing.NDArray[np.float32], min_divisor: float = 1e-8, zca_bias: float = 0.001) -> np.typing.NDArray[np.float32]:
        # Implement the function as described in the prompt
```
