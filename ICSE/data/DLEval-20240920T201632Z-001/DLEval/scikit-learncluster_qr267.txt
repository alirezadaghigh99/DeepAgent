prompt:
Generate a Python function called cluster_qr that finds the discrete partition closest to the eigenvector embedding. The input is an array-like object called vectors with shape (n_samples, n_clusters) representing the embedding space of the samples. The output is an array of integers called labels with shape n_samples, representing the cluster labels of the vectors.
