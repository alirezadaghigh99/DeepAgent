prompt:

Generate a Python method `compose` for the `Transform3d` class that combines the current transform with any number of other `Transform3d` objects passed as arguments. The method should return a new `Transform3d` instance representing the composed transformation, which combines the internal transformation matrix of the current instance with those of the provided transforms. Ensure that the internal list of transformations (`self._transforms`) is updated accordingly. The method should also verify that all provided arguments are instances of `Transform3d`.

Class structure:

```python
class Transform3d:
    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: Device = "cpu", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):
        self._matrix = ...
        self._transforms = []
        self.device = ...
        self.dtype = ...

    def compose(self, *others: "Transform3d") -> "Transform3d":
        # Implement the function as described in the prompt
```
