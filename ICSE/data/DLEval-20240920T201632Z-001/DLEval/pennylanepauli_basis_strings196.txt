prompt:
Generate a Python function called pauli_basis_strings that computes all n-qubit Pauli words except "I"*num_wires, corresponding to the Pauli basis of the Lie algebra su(N). The input is an integer num_wires representing the number of wires or letters per word. The output is a list of strings representing all Pauli words on num_wires qubits, except for the identity. The function returns the Pauli words in a specific order, either lexicographically or based on the change in terms acting on the qubits. The function also provides examples of its usage, such as pauli_basis_strings(1) returning ['X', 'Y', 'Z'] and len(pauli_basis_strings(3)) returning 63.
