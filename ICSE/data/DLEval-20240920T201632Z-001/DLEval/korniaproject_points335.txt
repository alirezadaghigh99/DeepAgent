prompt:
Generate a Python function called project_points that takes in a 3D point tensor and a camera matrix tensor as input. The function projects the 3D point onto the 2D camera plane using the camera matrix. The input tensor for the 3D point should have shape (*, 3) and the camera matrix tensor should have shape (*, 3, 3). The function returns a tensor of (u, v) camera coordinates with shape (*, 2). An example usage of the function is provided where a random 3D point and an identity matrix as the camera matrix are used to project the point onto the camera plane, resulting in a tensor of camera coordinates.
