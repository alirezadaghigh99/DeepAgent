prompt:
Generate a Python function called diff that calculates the derivative of a variable with respect to another variable. The function takes in two torch tensors u and t, representing the variables, an optional parameter order for the order of the derivative (default is 1), and a boolean parameter shape_check for performing shape checking (default is True). The function returns the derivative evaluated at t as a torch tensor.
