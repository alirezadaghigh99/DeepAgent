data: Image

prompt:Implement a function named `save_image` that saves a PyTorch tensor or a list of tensors as an image file. The function takes the following inputs: `tensor`, which can be either a single PyTorch tensor or a list of tensors representing images; `fp`, which can be a string, `pathlib.Path`, or a file-like object specifying the file path or object to save the image; and an optional `format` string to specify the image format. If no format is provided, it will be inferred from the file extension unless a file object is used, in which case the format must be specified. Additional keyword arguments are passed to `make_grid`, which arranges the tensor into a grid if it represents a mini-batch. The function converts the tensor to a NumPy array after normalizing and clamping it to the [0, 255] range, then saves the resulting image using the PIL library. The function does not return anything (`None`).
