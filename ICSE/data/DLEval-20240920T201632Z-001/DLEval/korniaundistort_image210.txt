data: Image

prompt:
Generate a Python function called undistort_image that compensates an image for lens distortion. The function takes in three inputs: image (a torch.Tensor representing the input image with shape (*, C, H, W)), K (a torch.Tensor representing the intrinsic camera matrix with shape (*, 3, 3)), and dist (a torch.Tensor representing the distortion coefficients with shape (*, n)). The distortion coefficients include radial, tangential, thin prism, and tilt distortion models.

The function returns an undistorted image with the same shape as the input image (*, C, H, W). 

For example:
```python
img = torch.rand(1, 3, 5, 5)
K = torch.eye(3)[None]
dist_coeff = torch.rand(1, 4)
out = undistort_image(img, K, dist_coeff)
out.shape
```

The output shape of the undistorted image will be torch.Size([1, 3, 5, 5).
