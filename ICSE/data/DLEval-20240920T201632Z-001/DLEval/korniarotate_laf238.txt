prompt:
Create a function `rotate_laf` that applies an additional rotation to a Local Affine Frame (LAF). The function takes in a tensor `LAF` of shape `(B, N, 2, 3)` and a tensor `angles_degrees` of shape `(B, N, 1)` representing rotation angles in degrees. It returns the rotated LAF with the same shape. The function raises an error if the input LAF is not properly structured.
