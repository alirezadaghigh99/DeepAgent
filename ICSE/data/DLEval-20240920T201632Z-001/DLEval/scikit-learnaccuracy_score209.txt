prompt:
Generate a Python function called accuracy_score that calculates the accuracy classification score. The function takes in the following parameters:

- y_true: Ground truth (correct) labels
- y_pred: Predicted labels
- normalize: Boolean value indicating whether to return the fraction of correctly classified samples or the number of correctly classified samples
- sample_weight: Sample weights

The function returns a float or integer value based on the normalize parameter. The best performance is 1 when normalize is True and the number of samples when normalize is False.

The function also includes examples demonstrating how to use it with different inputs.
