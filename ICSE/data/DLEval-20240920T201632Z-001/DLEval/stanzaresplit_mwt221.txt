prompt:
Create a Python function called resplit_mwt that takes in three parameters: tokens (a list of lists of strings), pipeline (a Stanza pipeline containing tokenize and mwt processors), and keep_tokens (a boolean indicating whether to enforce old token boundaries). 

The function uses the tokenize processor and the mwt processor in the pipeline to resplit tokens into multi-word tokens (MWT). It first checks if the pipeline contains the necessary processors, then sets up batches for tokenization. 

After predicting token boundaries, the function optionally modifies the results based on the keep_tokens parameter. It then decodes the predictions and processes the document using the mwt processor. 

The function returns a Document object with the tokens and words annotated.
