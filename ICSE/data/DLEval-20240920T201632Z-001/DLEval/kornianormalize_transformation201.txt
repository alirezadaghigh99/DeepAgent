Create a Python function `normalize_transformation` that:

- Accepts two parameters:
  - `M`: A tensor representing a transformation matrix of any shape with at least 2x2 dimensions.
  - `eps`: A small float value (default is `1e-8`) used to avoid numerical instabilities during backpropagation.
- The function normalizes the input transformation matrix `M` so that the value in the last row and column is set to one.
- Returns the normalized transformation matrix with the same shape as the input.

Errors:
- Raises an `AssertionError` if the input matrix `M` has fewer than 2 dimensions.
