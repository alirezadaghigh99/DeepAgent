data: Image

prompt:
Generate a Python function called normal_transform_pixel3d that computes the normalization matrix from image size in pixels to the range [-1, 1]. The function takes in the image depth, height, width, epsilon value (eps), device, and data type (dtype) as inputs. It returns a normalized transform matrix with a shape of (1, 4, 4). The function first creates a 4x4 tensor matrix and then adjusts the values based on the image dimensions to prevent divide-by-zero errors. Finally, it returns the normalized transform matrix with a shape of 1x4x4.
