prompt:
Generate a Python function called `_compute_tf_loss` that calculates the softmax cross entropy loss between output logits and labels using TensorFlow. The inputs are tensors of logits and labels with shapes `(batch_size, classes)` or `(batch_size, tasks, classes)`, and the output is a tensor of loss values.

```python
class SoftmaxCrossEntropy(Loss):
    def _compute_tf_loss(self, output, labels):
```
