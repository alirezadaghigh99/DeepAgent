prompt:
Write a Python function _box_xyxy_to_cxcywh that converts bounding boxes from the (x1, y1, x2, y2) format, where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) represent the top-left and bottom-right corners, to the (cx, cy, w, h) format, where (cx, cy) represents the center and (w, h) represents the width and height. The function should return a tensor with the converted bounding boxes.
