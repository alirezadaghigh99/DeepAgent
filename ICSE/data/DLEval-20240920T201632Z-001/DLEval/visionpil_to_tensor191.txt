data: Image

prompt:
Generate a Python function called pil_to_tensor that converts a PIL Image to a tensor of the same type. The input parameter is a PIL Image called pic. The function does not support torchscript. It performs a deep copy of the underlying array. If the input is not a PIL Image, a TypeError is raised. If the input is an accimage Image, the function returns a tensor of type uint8. Otherwise, it converts the PIL Image to a tensor, rearranges the dimensions, and returns the tensor.
