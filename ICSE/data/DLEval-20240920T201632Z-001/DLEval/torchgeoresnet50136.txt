prompt:
Generate a Python function called resnet50 that creates a ResNet-50 model. The function takes in optional pre-trained model weights, additional arguments, and keyword arguments. If weights are provided, the function sets the input channels based on the weights. The function then creates a ResNet-50 model using the timm library. If weights are provided, the function loads the state dictionary from the weights and ensures that certain keys are present. The function returns the ResNet-50 model.
