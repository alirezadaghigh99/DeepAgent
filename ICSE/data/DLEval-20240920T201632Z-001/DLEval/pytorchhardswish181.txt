Create a Python function called hardswish that applies the hardswish function element-wise to a given input tensor. The function follows the implementation described in the paper "Searching for MobileNetV3". The hardswish function is defined as follows:
- Returns 0 if x is less than or equal to -3
- Returns x if x is greater than or equal to +3
- Returns x * (x + 3) / 6 otherwise

The input to the function is a PyTorch tensor called input, and there is an optional boolean parameter called inplace which defaults to False. The output of the function is also a PyTorch tensor.
