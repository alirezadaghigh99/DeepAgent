prompt:
Create a Python function `_iterate_shift_rule_with_multipliers` that helps in applying a shift rule with multipliers repeatedly along the same parameter axis, particularly for higher-order derivatives. The function should accept a `rule` (containing coefficients, multipliers, and shifts), an `order` specifying how many times to repeat the shift rule, and an optional `period` to handle periodic boundary conditions. It should iterate over all possible combinations of the shift rule applied `order` times, compute the cumulative shifts and multipliers, and return a stacked array of combined rules with columns corresponding to coefficients, multipliers, and cumulative shifts. If a `period` is provided, the shifts should be adjusted to stay within the specified periodic range. The function is useful in quantum computing or other contexts where repeated application of parameter shifts is needed for derivative calculations. use qml for this question
