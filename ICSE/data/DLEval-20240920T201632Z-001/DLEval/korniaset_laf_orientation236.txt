Generate a Python function called set_laf_orientation that changes the orientation of the Local Affine Frames (LAFs). The function takes in two arguments: LAF, a tensor of shape (B, N, 2, 3) representing the LAFs, and angles_degrees, a tensor of shape (B, N, 1) representing the angles in degrees. The function returns a tensor of shape (B, N, 2, 3) representing the LAFs oriented with the specified angles. T
