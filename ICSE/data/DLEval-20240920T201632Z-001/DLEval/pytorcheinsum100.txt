prompt:
Generate a Python function called einsum that implements the Einstein summation convention for multi-dimensional linear algebraic array operations. The function takes in an equation string and a variable number of operands (tensors) and computes the sum of the product of the elements of the operands along dimensions specified in the equation. The output is a tensor.

The equation string specifies the subscripts for each dimension of the operands, with optional output subscripts defined using an arrow ('->'). The function supports broadcasting, ellipsis ('...') for dimensions, and sublist format for subscripts. It uses opt_einsum for optimized contraction order when there are at least three inputs. 

Examples of using the einsum function include computing matrix multiplication, diagonal, outer product, batch matrix multiplication, batch permute, and equivalent operations to torch.nn.functional.bilinear.
