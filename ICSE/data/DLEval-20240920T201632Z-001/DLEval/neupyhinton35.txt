prompt:
Generate a Python function called hinton that draws a Hinton diagram for visualizing a weight matrix. The function takes in the following parameters:

- matrix: array-like, the matrix that you want to visualize using the Hinton diagram.
- max_weight: float, the maximum value of the matrix. If set to None, the value will be calculated using the maximum from the matrix.
- ax: object, a Matplotlib Axes instance. If set to None, a new Axes instance will be generated.
- add_legend: boolean, a flag to determine whether to add a legend to the diagram. Defaults to True.

The function returns a Matplotlib Axes instance. The Hinton diagram is drawn by representing each element in the matrix as a square, with the color indicating the sign of the value and the size indicating the magnitude relative to the max_weight.
