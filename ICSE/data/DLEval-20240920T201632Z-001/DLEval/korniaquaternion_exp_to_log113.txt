prompt:
Generate a Python function called quaternion_exp_to_log that applies the log map to a quaternion. The input is a tensor called quaternion in (w, x, y, z) format and a float called eps for clamping. The output is a tensor of shape (*, 3) representing the quaternion log map. The function checks if the input is a Tensor and has a shape of (*, 4). It then unpacks the quaternion into a vector and scalar, computes the quaternion norm, and applies the log map to calculate the quaternion log. An example usage is provided with a sample quaternion input. >>> quaternion = tensor((1., 0., 0., 0.))
        >>> quaternion_exp_to_log(quaternion, eps=torch.finfo(quaternion.dtype).eps)
        tensor([0., 0., 0.])
