data: Image

prompt:
Generate a Python function called left_jacobian that computes the left Jacobian of So3. The input is a tensor called vec of shape (B, 3) where B is the batch size. The output is a tensor of shape (B, 3, 3) representing the left Jacobian matrix. The function uses the input tensor to calculate the left Jacobian matrix using specific mathematical operations
