prompt:
Generate a Python function called symeig3x3 that computes eigenvalues and (optionally) eigenvectors of symmetric matrices with shape of (..., 3, 3). The function takes inputs as a torch.Tensor and an optional boolean parameter eigenvectors to determine whether to compute only eigenvalues or both eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The output is either a tuple of (eigenvalues, eigenvectors) or eigenvalues only, depending on the given parameters. Eigenvalues are of shape (..., 3) and eigenvectors are of shape (..., 3, 3).
