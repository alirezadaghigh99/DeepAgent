prompt:
Generate a Python function called tswspectral_layout that computes the spectral embedding of a graph. The function takes in various parameters such as data, graph, dim, random_state, metric, metric_kwds, method, tol, and maxiter. It utilizes the normalized Laplacian and a truncated SVD-based approach to find the eigenvectors of the graph. The function aims to provide results similar to the spectral_layout function but may converge more quickly for certain types of graph Laplacians. The output is an array representing the spectral embedding of the graph.
