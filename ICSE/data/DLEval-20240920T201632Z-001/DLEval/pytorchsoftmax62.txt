prompt:
Generate a Python function called softmax that applies the softmax function to a given input tensor along a specified dimension. The function takes in parameters input (a tensor), dim (an optional integer representing the dimension along which softmax will be computed), _stacklevel (an integer), and dtype (an optional data type for the returned tensor). The softmax function is defined as dividing the exponential of each element in the input tensor by the sum of exponentials of all elements along the specified dimension. The output is a tensor with elements rescaled to lie in the range [0, 1] and sum to 1. The function also includes a note recommending the use of log_softmax for compatibility with NLLLoss.
