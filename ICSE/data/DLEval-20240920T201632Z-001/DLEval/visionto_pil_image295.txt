data: Image

prompt:
write a python function to_pil_image Convert a tensor or a numpy array to a PIL Image, ensuring compatibility with expected modes and handling potential errors.

**Inputs:**
- `pic` (Tensor or numpy.ndarray): The image data to be converted.
- `mode` (optional, str): The desired color mode for the output PIL Image. Supported modes are based on the number of channels in the image and include:

  - For 1-channel images: `"L"` for grayscale, `"I"` for 32-bit signed integer pixels, `"I;16"` for 16-bit unsigned integer pixels, and `"F"` for floating-point pixels.
  - For 2-channel images: `"LA"` for grayscale with alpha channel.
  - For 3-channel images: `"RGB"` for standard RGB, `"YCbCr"` for color video format, `"HSV"` for hue, saturation, value.
  - For 4-channel images: `"RGBA"` for RGB with alpha channel, `"CMYK"` for prepress, `"RGBX"` for RGB with padding.

**Outputs:**
- Returns a PIL Image converted from the input data.

**Error Handling:**
- Raises `TypeError` if the input is not a Tensor or numpy array.
- Raises `ValueError` if the input image is not 2D or 3D.
- Raises `ValueError` if the image has more than 4 channels.
- Raises `ValueError` if the specified mode is incompatible with the input data.
- Raises `TypeError` if the mode is not supported for the given input type.
