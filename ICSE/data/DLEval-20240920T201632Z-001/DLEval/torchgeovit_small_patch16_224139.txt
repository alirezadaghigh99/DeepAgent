prompt:
Generate a Python function called vit_small_patch16_224 that creates a Vision Transformer (ViT) model with small patch size 16. The function takes in optional pre-trained model weights, additional arguments, and keyword arguments. If weights are provided, the function adjusts the input channels based on the weights. The function then creates a ViT small 16 model using the timm library, loads the pre-trained weights if available, and returns the model.
