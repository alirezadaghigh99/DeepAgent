stage: Pre-Post processing
task: 
data: Image

prompt:Create a Python function `resize` that resizes an input image (either a Tensor or a PIL Image) to a specified size. The function accepts the following parameters: `img` (the image to be resized), `size` (the desired output size), `interpolation` (the method for resizing), `max_size` (optional, to limit the size of the longer edge), and `antialias` (optional, to apply antialiasing for certain modes).

Error handling includes:
- Raising a `TypeError` if `interpolation` is not an `InterpolationMode` or a corresponding Pillow integer constant.
- Raising a `ValueError` if `size` is not an integer or a list/tuple of length 1 or 2, or if `max_size` is provided when `size` is not a single integer.
- Warning the user if `antialias` is set to `False` but the input is a PIL Image, as antialiasing is always applied in that case.

The function returns the resized image, maintaining the aspect ratio if necessary and handling both PIL Images and Tensors appropriately.
