prompt:
Generate a Python function called create_knn_graph_and_index that calculates the KNN graph from input features. The function takes in a feature array, optional parameters for the number of nearest neighbors and distance metric, a boolean flag for correcting exact duplicates, and additional keyword arguments for the search index constructor. 

The function returns a tuple containing a sparse, weighted adjacency matrix representing the KNN graph of the feature array and a k-nearest neighbors search object fitted to the input feature array. The function also includes examples demonstrating its usage with numpy arrays.
