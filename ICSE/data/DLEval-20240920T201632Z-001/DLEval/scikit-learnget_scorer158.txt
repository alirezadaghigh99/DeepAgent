data: Table

prompt:
Generate a Python function called get_scorer that takes a parameter called scoring. The function retrieves a scorer based on the input scoring method, which can be a string, a callable, or None. If the input is a string, the function returns a copy of the scorer object corresponding to that string. If the input is a callable, the function returns the input as is. If the input is None, the function returns None.

The function includes a docstring with information on how to use it, including examples. It also handles errors by raising a ValueError if the input scoring value is not valid.

The function returns the scorer object based on the input scoring method.
