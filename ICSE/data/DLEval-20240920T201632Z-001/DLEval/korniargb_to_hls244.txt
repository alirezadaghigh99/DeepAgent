data: Image

prompt:
Generate a Python function called rgb_to_hls that converts an RGB image to HLS format. The function takes in a PyTorch tensor called image representing the RGB image with shape (*, 3, H, W) and an epsilon value eps to avoid division by zero. The image data is assumed to be in the range of (0, 1).

The function returns the HLS version of the input image with the same shape (*, 3, H, W). If the input image is not a PyTorch tensor, a TypeError is raised. If the input size does not have a shape of (*, 3, H, W), a ValueError is raised.

The conversion process involves calculating the HLS components (hue, luminance, saturation) based on the RGB values of the input image. The resulting HLS image is returned as a PyTorch tensor.

An example usage of the rgb_to_hls function is provided in the code snippet, where a random input RGB image tensor is converted to HLS format. Raise the value error if there input not instance of image or there was a problem with shape
