stage: Pre-Post processing
task: 
data: Image

prompt:Create a Python function called convert_image_dtype that Convert a tensor image to the given ``dtype`` and scale the values accordingly
    This function does not support PIL Image.

    Args:
        image (torch.Tensor): Image to be converted
        dtype (torch.dtype): Desired data type of the output

    Returns:
        Tensor: Converted image

    .. note::

        When converting from a smaller to a larger integer ``dtype`` the maximum values are **not** mapped exactly.
        If converted back and forth, this mismatch has no effect.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: When trying to cast :class:`torch.float32` to :class:`torch.int32` or :class:`torch.int64` as
            well as for trying to cast :class:`torch.float64` to :class:`torch.int64`. These conversions might lead to
            overflow errors since the floating point ``dtype`` cannot store consecutive integers over the whole range
            of the integer ``dtype``.
