prompt:
Generate a Python function called modified_precision that computes the modified precision for a given list of references, a candidate translation, and an n-gram order. The function calculates the number of matched n-grams between the candidate translation and its references, and the total number of n-grams in the translation. The output is a tuple containing the sum of the clipped counts of the candidate and references, and the sum of the counts of the candidate.
