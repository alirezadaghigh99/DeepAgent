prompt:
Create a Python class called fit with a method called fit that fits the local Laplace approximation at the parameters of a model. The method takes in parameters train_loader (a torch DataLoader), override (a boolean with a default value of True), and progress_bar (a boolean with a default value of False). If override is set to False, a ValueError is raised. The method then sets the model to evaluation mode, finds the last layer of the model, initializes certain parameters, and fits the model using the train_loader. Finally, the method sets the mean parameter and detaches it if backpropagation is disabled.
