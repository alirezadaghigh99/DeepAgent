prompt:
Generate a Python method `_entropy` for the `CategoryVectorInconsistencyAndRanking` class that computes the entropy of a given distribution. The method should take as input the numerator and denominator of the distribution and return the entropy. The method should account for numerical stability using a small epsilon value.

Class structure:

```python
class CategoryVectorInconsistencyAndRanking(QueryStrategy):
    def __init__(self, batch_size=2048, prediction_threshold=0.5, epsilon=1e-8, pbar='tqdm'):
        # Initialization code...

    def _entropy(self, numerator, denominator):
        # Implement the function as described in the prompt
putes the distance metric between predicted and true labels
```
