stage: Pre-Post processing
task: segmentation
data: Image

prompt:
Create a Python function expand_image_array_cnn that ensures an input image array is in the correct format for use in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). If the input is a 2D grayscale image, the function converts it to a 3D array by repeating the grayscale values across three channels (i.e., converting it to an RGB-like format). If the input is already a 3D array, the function validates its dimensions.

Parameters:
image_arr: A NumPy array representing the input image. The array can be 2D (grayscale) or 3D (RGB).
Returns:
A 3D NumPy array representing the image. If the input is a 2D array, it is converted to a 3D array by repeating the grayscale values across three channels.
