task: 
data: Image

prompt:
Generate a Python function called find_fundamental 
Args:
        points1: A set of points in the first image with a tensor shape :math:`(B, N, 2), N>=8`.
        points2: A set of points in the second image with a tensor shape :math:`(B, N, 2), N>=8`.
        weights: Tensor containing the weights per point correspondence with a shape of :math:`(B, N)`.
        method: The method to use for computing the fundamental matrix. Supported methods are "7POINT" and "8POINT".

    Returns:
        the computed fundamental matrix with shape :math:`(B, 3*m, 3)`, where `m` number of fundamental matrix.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If an invalid method is provided.
