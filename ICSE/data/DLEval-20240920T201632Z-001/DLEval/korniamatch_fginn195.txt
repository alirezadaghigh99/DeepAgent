prompt:
Generate a Python function called match_fginn that finds nearest neighbors in desc2 for each vector in desc1. The inputs are Tensors desc1, desc2, lafs1, lafs2, th, spatial_th, mutual, and dm. The function returns a tuple of Tensors containing the descriptor distance of matching descriptors and the long tensor indexes of matching descriptors in desc1 and desc2. The function also performs a mutual nearest neighbor check if specified.
def match_fginn(
    desc1: Tensor,
    desc2: Tensor,
    lafs1: Tensor,
    lafs2: Tensor,
    th: float = 0.8,
    spatial_th: float = 10.0,
    mutual: bool = False,
    dm: Optional[Tensor] = None,
) -> Tuple[Tensor, Tensor]:
