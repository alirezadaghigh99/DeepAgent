prompt:
Create a Python function called rescale that resizes an input torch.Tensor with the given factor. The function takes in the following parameters: input (torch.Tensor), factor (float or tuple of floats), interpolation (string, default="bilinear"), align_corners (optional bool), and antialias (bool, default=False). 

The function rescales the input tensor based on the factor provided, using the specified interpolation method. If a scalar factor is provided, it is used for both the x and y directions. The function returns the rescaled tensor with the shape specified by the new size.

An example of using the rescale function is shown below:
```python
img = torch.rand(1, 3, 4, 4)
out = rescale(img, (2, 3))
print(out.shape)
```
This example rescales the input image tensor 'img' by a factor of (2, 3) and prints out the shape of the resulting tensor.
