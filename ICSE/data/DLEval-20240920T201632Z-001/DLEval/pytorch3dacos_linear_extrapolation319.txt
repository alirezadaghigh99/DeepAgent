prompt:
Create a Python function named acos_linear_extrapolation that computes the arccosine of a tensor, with linear extrapolation applied outside the domain

)
(−1,1) for stable backpropagation. The function should take a tensor x and a tuple bounds representing the lower and upper bounds for the extrapolation region. If the value of x is within the bounds, the function should return the standard arccos(x) value. If x is outside the bounds, it should apply a first-order Taylor approximation for extrapolation. The function should validate that the bounds are within the valid range

(−1,1) and that the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound. The function returns a tensor containing the computed values.

Inputs:

x (torch.Tensor): The input tensor for which to compute the arccosine.
bounds (Tuple[float, float]): A tuple containing the lower and upper bounds for the linear extrapolation.
Outputs:

Returns a tensor containing the extrapolated arccos(x) values.
Error Handling:

Raise a ValueError if the bounds are outside the range
