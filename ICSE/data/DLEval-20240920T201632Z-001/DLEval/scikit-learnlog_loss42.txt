prompt:
Generate a Python function called log_loss that calculates the log loss, also known as logistic loss or cross-entropy loss. The function takes in the following parameters:

- y_true: Ground truth labels for n_samples samples.
- y_pred: Predicted probabilities from a classifier's predict_proba method.
- normalize: A boolean indicating whether to return the mean loss per sample or the sum of per-sample losses.
- sample_weight: Optional sample weights.
- labels: Optional labels for the classes.

The function calculates the log loss based on the predicted probabilities and true labels. It returns the log loss as a float value. The function also includes examples, notes, and references for further information.
