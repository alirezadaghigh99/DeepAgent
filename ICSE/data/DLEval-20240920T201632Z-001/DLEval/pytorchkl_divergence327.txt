prompt:
Generate a Python function called kl_divergence that computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence KL(p \| q) between two distributions. The function takes two input parameters, p and q, which are objects of the class torch.distributions.Distribution. The output is a torch.Tensor representing a batch of KL divergences with shape `batch_shape`. If the specific KL divergence calculation for the given distribution types has not been implemented, a NotImplementedError will be raised.
