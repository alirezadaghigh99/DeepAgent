prompt:
Generate a Python function called unproject_points_z1 that unprojects one or more points from the canonical z=1 plane into the camera frame. The function takes in a Tensor called points_in_cam_canonical representing the points to unproject with shape (..., 2) and an optional Tensor called extension representing the extension (depth) of the points with shape (..., 1). The function returns a Tensor representing the unprojected points with shape (..., 3). An example usage of the function is provided where points and extension are tensors, and the output is a tensor of unprojected points.
