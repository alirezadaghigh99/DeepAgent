task: Classification
data: Table

prompt:
Generate a Python function called pair_confusion_matrix that calculates a 2 by 2 similarity matrix between two clusterings. The function takes two array-like inputs, labels_true and labels_pred, which represent the ground truth class labels and cluster labels to be evaluated, respectively. The function returns a numpy ndarray of shape (2, 2) containing the contingency matrix. The function also performs computations using the contingency data to calculate the elements of the matrix. The function includes examples demonstrating how to use it with different labelings.
