task: Detection
data: Image

prompt:
Create a Python function draw_rectangle that draws one or more rectangles on a batch of image tensors. The function accepts the following parameters:

image: A tensor of shape (B, C, H, W), where B is the batch size, C is the number of channels, H is the height, and W is the width of the images.
rectangle: A tensor of shape (B, N, 4), where N is the number of rectangles per image, and each rectangle is defined by four coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2) corresponding to the top-left and bottom-right corners.
color: An optional tensor specifying the color of the rectangles. It can be of various shapes: (1,), (3,), (B, N, 1), or (B, N, 3). If the image has 3 channels and the color tensor has 1 channel, the color will be broadcasted.
fill: An optional boolean flag indicating whether to fill the rectangles with color (True) or just draw the borders (False). Defaults to False.
The function modifies the input image tensor in place, drawing the specified rectangles according to the provided parameters. It also returns the modified image tensor for convenience.

Error Handling:
Raise an AssertionError if the batch size of the image tensor does not match the batch size of the rectangle tensor.
Raise an AssertionError if the number of points in the rectangle tensor is not 4.
