prompt:
Write python function, `transform_points`,  in torch transforms a set of 3D points using a transformation matrix. Here's a breakdown of its key elements:

### Inputs:
- **points**: A tensor of shape `(P, 3)` or `(N, P, 3)`, where `P` is the number of points, `3` represents the 3D coordinates (x, y, z), and `N` is an optional batch size.
- **eps**: An optional float used for clamping the last coordinate (typically the homogeneous coordinate) before division to prevent division by zero.

### Process:
1. **Reshape Input**: If `points` is 2D (`P, 3`), it's reshaped to 3D (`1, P, 3`) to accommodate batch processing.
2. **Validation**: Ensures that the input tensor is either 2D or 3D.
3. **Augment Points**: A column of ones is appended to the points tensor to enable affine transformations.
4. **Apply Transformation**: The points are multiplied by the transformation matrix obtained from `self.get_matrix()`.
5. **Clamping (if `eps` is provided)**: The denominator (typically the homogeneous coordinate) is clamped to avoid division by zero.
6. **Divide by Homogeneous Coordinate**: The resulting coordinates are divided by the clamped or original homogeneous coordinate.
7. **Reshape Output**: If the original points were 2D, the output is reshaped back to 2D.

### Output:
- **points_out**: The transformed points, returned in the same shape as the input points (either `(P, 3)` or `(N, P, 3)`).

### Error Handling:
- Raises a `ValueError` if the input points tensor does not have a dimension of 2 or 3.

This function effectively applies a transformation matrix to a set of 3D points, handling cases where division by zero might occur during homogeneous coordinate normalization.
