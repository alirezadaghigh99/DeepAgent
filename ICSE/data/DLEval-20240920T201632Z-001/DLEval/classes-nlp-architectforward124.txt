prompt:
Generate a Python function called `forward` that fake quantizes the input according to the given scale and number of bits, and then dequantizes the result using the provided scale. The input is a tensor, the scale is a float, and the number of bits is an integer with a default value of 8. The output is a tensor.

```python
class FakeLinearQuantizationWithSTE(torch.autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, input, scale, bits=8):
```
