task: Classification
data: Image

prompt:
Generate a Python function named shift_rgb that shifts the RGB channels of an image. The function takes the following inputs: an image tensor of shape (N, C, H, W), where C is 3 (indicating an RGB image), and three tensors r_shift, g_shift, and b_shift of shape (N) that represent the shift values for the red, green, and blue channels, respectively.

The function should:

Verify that the image is a valid tensor and a color image.
Apply the shifts to each channel.
Ensure the output values are clamped between 0 and 1.
Return the modified image as a tensor of the same shape.
The function should handle errors by checking the tensor types and confirming that the input image is an RGB image."
example of input : image = tensor([[[[0.2000, 0.0000]],

         [[0.3000, 0.5000]],

         [[0.4000, 0.7000]]],


        [[[0.2000, 0.7000]],

         [[0.0000, 0.8000]],

         [[0.2000, 0.3000]]]]), r_shift = tensor([0.1000]), g_shift = tensor([0.3000]), b_shift = tensor([-0.3000])
