prompt:
Generate a Python function called d2_log_loss_score that calculates the D^2 score, which is the fraction of log loss explained. The function takes in the following parameters:

- y_true: array-like or label indicator matrix, representing the actual labels for the samples.
- y_pred: array-like of shape (n_samples, n_classes) or (n_samples,), representing the predicted probabilities from a classifier.
- sample_weight: array-like of shape (n_samples,), representing sample weights.
- labels: array-like, representing the labels. If not provided, they will be inferred from y_true.

The function returns the D^2 score as a float or ndarray of floats. It may be negative and is not well-defined for a single sample. The best possible score is 1.0, and a model that always predicts the per-class proportions of y_true gets a score of 0.0. The function also handles cases where the number of samples is less than two, returning a NaN value in such cases.if _num_samples(y_pred) < 2:
        msg = "D^2 score is not well-defined with less than two samples."
        warnings.warn(msg, UndefinedMetricWarning)
        return float("nan")
