prompt:
Create a Python function `convert_pointclouds_to_tensor` that:

- Takes as input either a `torch.Tensor` or a `Pointclouds` object (`pcl`).
- If `pcl` is a `Pointclouds` object, it converts the point cloud to a padded tensor representation and returns it along with the number of points per batch.
- If `pcl` is a `torch.Tensor`, it returns the tensor itself and the number of points set to the size of the second dimension of `pcl`.
- Raises a `ValueError` if the input is neither a `Pointclouds` object nor a `torch.Tensor`.
