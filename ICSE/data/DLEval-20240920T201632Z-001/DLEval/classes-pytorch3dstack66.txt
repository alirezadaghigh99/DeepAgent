Generate a Python method `stack` for the `Transform3d` class that returns a new `Transform3d` object representing a batched combination of the current instance and any number of additional `Transform3d` objects. The method should concatenate the transformation matrices of the current instance and the provided `Transform3d` objects along the batch dimension and return a new `Transform3d` object with the resulting matrix.

Class structure:

```python
class Transform3d:
    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: Device = "cpu", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):
        self._matrix = ...
        self._transforms = []
        self.device = ...
        self.dtype = ...

    def stack(self, *others: "Transform3d") -> "Transform3d":
        # Implement the function as described in the prompt
```
