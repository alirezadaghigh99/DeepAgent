prompt:
Create a Python function called deform_conv2d that performs Deformable Convolution v2 or Deformable Convolution based on the presence of a mask. The function takes input, offset, weight, and optional bias tensors along with stride, padding, dilation, and mask parameters. It returns the result of the convolution operation as a tensor. The function also includes examples of how to use it with sample input tensors.
