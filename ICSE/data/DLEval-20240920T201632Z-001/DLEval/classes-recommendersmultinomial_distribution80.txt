prompt:

Generate a Python function `multinomial_distribution` for the class `RBM` that calculates the probability that a visible unit `v` has a specific value `l` given a linear combination `phi` of the values from the previous layer. The function should take as input a tensor `phi`, which represents the linear combination of inputs, and  Returns:
            tf.Tensor:
            - A tensor of shape (r, m, Nv): This needs to be reshaped as (m, Nv, r) in the last step to allow for faster sampling when used in the multinomial function.
```python
class RBM:
    def __init__(self, possible_ratings, visible_units, hidden_units=500, keep_prob=0.7, init_stdv=0.1, learning_rate=0.004, minibatch_size=100, training_epoch=20, display_epoch=10, sampling_protocol=[50, 70, 80, 90, 100], debug=False, with_metrics=False, seed=42):
        self.possible_ratings = possible_ratings
        pass

    def multinomial_distribution(self, phi):
        # Implement the function as described in the prompt
