stage: Evaluating&Metrics
task: segmentation
data: Image

prompt:
Create a Python function `issues_from_scores` that identifies mislabeled pixels or images based on label quality scores and a user-defined `threshold`. The function should accept:

- `image_scores` (np.ndarray): Array of shape `(N,)` for image scores.
- `pixel_scores` (Optional[np.ndarray]): Optional array of shape `(N, H, W)` for pixel-level scores.
- `threshold` (float): A value between 0 and 1 that determines which scores are considered issues.

The function returns:

- A boolean mask (np.ndarray) if `pixel_scores` is provided, marking issues as `True`.
- An array of image indices (np.ndarray) if `pixel_scores` is not provided, for images below the threshold.

Raise `ValueError` if `image_scores` is `None`, if `threshold` is outside the [0, 1] range, or if `threshold` is `None`.
