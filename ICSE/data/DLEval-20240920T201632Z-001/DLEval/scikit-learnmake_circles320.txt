prompt:
Generate a Python function called make_circles that creates a dataset with a large circle containing a smaller circle in 2D. The function takes the following parameters:

- n_samples: an integer or a tuple specifying the number of points in the outer and inner circles.
- shuffle: a boolean indicating whether to shuffle the samples.
- noise: a float representing the standard deviation of Gaussian noise added to the data.
- random_state: an integer, RandomState instance, or None for reproducible random number generation.
- factor: a float specifying the scale factor between the inner and outer circles.

The function returns two arrays:
- X: an ndarray of shape (n_samples, 2) containing the generated samples.
- y: an ndarray of shape (n_samples,) with integer labels (0 or 1) for the class membership of each sample.

The function also includes examples of how to use it, including generating the dataset and accessing the shapes of X and y.if len(n_samples) != 2:
            raise ValueError("When a tuple, n_samples must have exactly two elements.")
