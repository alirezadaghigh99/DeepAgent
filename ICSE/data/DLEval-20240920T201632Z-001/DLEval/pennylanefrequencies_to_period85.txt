prompt:
Generate a Python function called frequencies_to_period that calculates the period of a Fourier series based on a set of frequencies. The input parameters are a tuple of frequencies called frequencies and an optional parameter for the number of decimal places to round to called decimals. The function returns a tuple of frequencies.

The period is calculated as 2Ï€/gcd(frequencies), where gcd is the greatest common divisor of the frequencies.

If the frequencies are not integers, the function rounds them to the specified number of decimal places before calculating the period.

An example usage of the function is provided in the docstring:

frequencies = (0.5, 1.0)
frequencies_to_period(frequencies)

The expected output is 12.566370614359172.
