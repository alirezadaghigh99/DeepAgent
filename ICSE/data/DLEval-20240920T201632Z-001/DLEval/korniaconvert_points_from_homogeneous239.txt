prompt:
Create a function `convert_points_from_homogeneous` that converts points from homogeneous to Euclidean space. The function takes a tensor `points` with shape `(B, N, D)` and an optional `eps` parameter to avoid division by zero. It returns a tensor of shape `(B, N, D-1)` representing the points in Euclidean space. A `TypeError` is raised if the input is not a tensor, and a `ValueError` is raised if the input tensor has fewer than two dimensions.
