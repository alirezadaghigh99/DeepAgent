prompt:
Generate a Python function called box_area that computes the area of a set of bounding boxes specified by their (x1, y1, x2, y2) coordinates. The input is a tensor of shape (N, 4) called boxes, where N is the number of boxes. The boxes are expected to be in (x1, y1, x2, y2) format with 0 <= x1 < x2 and 0 <= y1 < y2. The function returns a tensor of shape (N) containing the area for each box.
