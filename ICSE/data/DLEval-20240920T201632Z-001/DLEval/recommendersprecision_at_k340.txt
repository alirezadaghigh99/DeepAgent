stage: Evaluating&Metrics
task: Recommendation
data: Table

prompt:
Create a Python function called precision_at_k that calculates the precision at K for a recommendation system. The function takes in the following parameters: rating_true (a pandas DataFrame representing the true ratings), rating_pred (a pandas DataFrame representing the predicted ratings), col_user (a string representing the column name for user), col_item (a string representing the column name for item), col_prediction (a string representing the column name for prediction), relevancy_method (a string representing the method for determining relevancy), k (an integer representing the number of top K items per user), and threshold (a float representing the threshold of top items per user).

The function returns a float value representing the precision at K, which is a value between 0 and 1. The precision at K is calculated based on the true and predicted ratings provided, taking into account the top K items per user and the relevancy method specified. The function also handles cases where the number of items for a user in the predicted ratings is less than K.
