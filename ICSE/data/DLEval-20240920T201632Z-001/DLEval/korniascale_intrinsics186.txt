prompt:
Create a Python function called scale_intrinsics that takes in a camera matrix (with shape (B, 3, 3)) containing intrinsic parameters and a scale factor (either a float or a tensor) as input. The function scales the focal length and center of projection in the camera matrix by the given scale factor. 

The function then returns the scaled camera matrix with the same shape as the input (B, 3, 3).
