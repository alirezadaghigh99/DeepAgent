prompt:
Generate a Python function `inference_quantized_forward` for the class `QuantizedLinear` that simulates a quantized inference forward pass. This function quantizes the input, performs the linear operation with quantized weights and biases, and then dequantizes the output. If `requantize_output` is enabled, the output is further quantized and then dequantized again. The function asserts that it should only be used in inference mode and not during training.

Class structure:

```python
class QuantizedLinear(QuantizedLayer, nn.Linear):
    def __init__(self, *args, activation_bits=8, requantize_output=True, ema_decay=0.9999, **kwargs):
        self.activation_bits = activation_bits  # Number of bits for quantization
        self.accumulation_bits = 32  # Number of bits for accumulation
        self.ema_decay = ema_decay  # EMA decay factor
        self.requantize_output = requantize_output  # Flag to requantize the output
        self.register_buffer("input_thresh", torch.zeros(1))  # Threshold for input quantization
        if self.requantize_output:
            self.register_buffer("output_thresh", torch.zeros(1))  # Threshold for output quantization
        pass

    def inference_quantized_forward(self, input):
        # Implement the function as described in the prompt
```

This function is designed to simulate the behavior of quantized operations during inference, working with quantized values for input, weights, and biases, and ensuring the final output is properly dequantized for use.
