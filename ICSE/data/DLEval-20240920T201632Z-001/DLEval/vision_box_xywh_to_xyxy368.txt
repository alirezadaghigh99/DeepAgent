prompt:
Write a Python function _box_xywh_to_xyxy that converts bounding boxes from the (x, y, w, h) format, where (x, y) represents the top-left corner and (w, h) represents the width and height, to the (x1, y1, x2, y2) format, where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) represent the top-left and bottom-right corners. The function should return a tensor with the converted bounding boxes.
