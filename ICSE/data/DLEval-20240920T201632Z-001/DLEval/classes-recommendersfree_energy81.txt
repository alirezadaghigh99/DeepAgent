prompt:

Generate a Python function `free_energy` for the class `RBM` that calculates the free energy of the visible units given the hidden units in the model. The function should take as input a tensor `x`, which can be either the sampled value of the visible units or the input data. It should compute the free energy by using the biases of the visible units (`self.bv`), the weights between the visible and hidden units (`self.w`), and the biases of the hidden units (`self.bh`). The function should return the free energy as a tf.tensor, calculated as the sum of the bias term.

```python
class RBM:
    def __init__(self, possible_ratings, visible_units, hidden_units=500, keep_prob=0.7, init_stdv=0.1, learning_rate=0.004, minibatch_size=100, training_epoch=20, display_epoch=10, sampling_protocol=[50, 70, 80, 90, 100], debug=False, with_metrics=False, seed=42):
        self.bv = None  # biases of the visible units
        self.bh = None  # biases of the hidden units
        self.w = None  # weights between visible and hidden units
        pass

    def free_energy(self, x):
        # Implement the function as described in the prompt
```
