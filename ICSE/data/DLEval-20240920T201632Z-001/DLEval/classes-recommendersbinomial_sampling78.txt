prompt:
Generate a Python function `binomial_sampling` for the class `RBM` that performs binomial sampling of hidden unit activations using a rejection method. The function should take as input a tensor `pr`, which represents the conditional probabilities of the hidden units being active, and compare each probability with a random value sampled from a uniform distribution The input is `pr` (tf.Tensor, float32), and the output is a tensor of the same shape with values of `1` or `0`.
```python
class RBM:
    def __init__(self, possible_ratings, visible_units, hidden_units=500, keep_prob=0.7, init_stdv=0.1, learning_rate=0.004, minibatch_size=100, training_epoch=20, display_epoch=10, sampling_protocol=[50, 70, 80, 90, 100], debug=False, with_metrics=False, seed=42):
        pass

    def binomial_sampling(self, pr):
        # Implement the function as described in the prompt
