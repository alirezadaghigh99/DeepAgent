```python
Generate a Python method `_loss` for the `ReweightedWakeSleep` class, which computes the re-weighted wake-sleep estimators for the model (`wake-theta`) and the guide (`phi`). The method should return the model loss (`wake_theta_loss`) and the guide loss (`phi_loss`).

The class structure:

```python
class ReweightedWakeSleep(ELBO):
    def __init__(self, num_particles=2, insomnia=1.0, model_has_params=True, num_sleep_particles=None, vectorize_particles=True, max_plate_nesting=float("inf"), strict_enumeration_warning=True):
        # Initialization code
        self.insomnia = insomnia  # Scaling factor for the wake-phi and sleep-phi terms
        self.model_has_params = model_has_params  # Indicates if the model has learnable parameters
        self.num_sleep_particles = num_particles if num_sleep_particles is None else num_sleep_particles  # Number of particles for sleep-phi estimator
        assert insomnia >= 0 and insomnia <= 1, "insomnia should be in [0, 1]"

    def _get_trace(self, model, guide, args, kwargs):
        # Returns a single trace from the guide, and the model that is run against it

    def _loss(self, model, guide, args, kwargs):
        # Returns the computed model loss (wake_theta_loss) and guide loss (phi_loss)

    def loss(self, model, guide, *args, **kwargs):
        # Calls _loss method and returns the model loss and guide loss

    def loss_and_grads(self, model, guide, *args, **kwargs):
        # Computes RWS estimators for the model and guide and performs backpropagation on both
```
```

In the `_loss` function:
- Calculate the `wake_theta_loss` using a weighted average of log joint probabilities from model traces.
- Calculate the `wake_phi_loss` using normalized importance weights and log probabilities from guide traces.
- Optionally, calculate the `sleep_phi_loss` using traces from the unconditioned model and the guide.
- Combine these into the final `phi_loss` based on the `insomnia` parameter.
- Return `wake_theta_loss` and `phi_loss`.
