prompt:
Generate a Python function called _smacof_single that Computes multidimensional scaling using SMACOF algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dissimilarities : ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_samples)
        Pairwise dissimilarities between the points. Must be symmetric.

    metric : bool, default=True
        Compute metric or nonmetric SMACOF algorithm.
        When ``False`` (i.e. non-metric MDS), dissimilarities with 0 are considered as
        missing values.

    n_components : int, default=2
        Number of dimensions in which to immerse the dissimilarities. If an
        ``init`` array is provided, this option is overridden and the shape of
        ``init`` is used to determine the dimensionality of the embedding
        space.

    init : ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_components), default=None
        Starting configuration of the embedding to initialize the algorithm. By
        default, the algorithm is initialized with a randomly chosen array.

    max_iter : int, default=300
        Maximum number of iterations of the SMACOF algorithm for a single run.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Level of verbosity.

    eps : float, default=1e-3
        Relative tolerance with respect to stress at which to declare
        convergence. The value of `eps` should be tuned separately depending
        on whether or not `normalized_stress` is being used.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines the random number generator used to initialize the centers.
        Pass an int for reproducible results across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    normalized_stress : bool, default=False
        Whether use and return normed stress value (Stress-1) instead of raw
        stress calculated by default. Only supported in non-metric MDS. The
        caller must ensure that if `normalized_stress=True` then `metric=False`

        .. versionadded:: 1.2

    Returns
    -------
    X : ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_components)
        Coordinates of the points in a ``n_components``-space.

    stress : float
        The final value of the stress (sum of squared distance of the
        disparities and the distances for all constrained points).
        If `normalized_stress=True`, and `metric=False` returns Stress-1.
        A value of 0 indicates "perfect" fit, 0.025 excellent, 0.05 good,
        0.1 fair, and 0.2 poor [1]_.

    n_iter : int
        The number of iterations corresponding to the best stress.
