stage: Model Construction
task: Classification
data: Table

prompt:
Generate a Python function called make_hastie_10_2 that generates data for binary classification as used in Hastie et al. 2009, Example 10.2. The function takes in the number of samples (n_samples) and a random state for reproducibility. It returns two arrays: X, which contains input samples of shape (n_samples, 10) with standard independent Gaussian features, and y, which contains output values of shape (n_samples,) defined by a specific condition. The target y[i] is set to 1 if the sum of X[i] squared is greater than 9.34, otherwise -1. The function utilizes numpy for array operations and includes references to related dataset approaches and literature. An example usage is provided to demonstrate the function's output shapes and initial values.
