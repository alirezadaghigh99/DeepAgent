prompt:
Generate a Python function called make_scorer that creates a scorer from a performance metric or loss function. The function takes in parameters such as score_func, response_method, greater_is_better, needs_proba, needs_threshold, and additional keyword arguments. It returns a callable object that computes a scalar score, with greater values indicating better performance. The function also provides examples of how to use it with different scoring functions and estimators.
