prompt:
Generate a Python function `_compute_tf_loss` for the class `L2Loss` that calculates the L2 loss using TensorFlow. Ensure the shapes of `output` and `labels` are consistent and they are of float type, then compute the squared difference between them.

Output format:

```python
class L2Loss(Loss):
    def _compute_tf_loss(self, output, labels):
```
