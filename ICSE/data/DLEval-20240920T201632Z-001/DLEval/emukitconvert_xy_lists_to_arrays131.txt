prompt:
Generate a Python function called convert_xy_lists_to_arrays that takes in two input parameters: x_list and y_list, both of type List. The function returns a Tuple containing two numpy arrays: x_array and y_array. 

The x_list parameter is a list of numpy arrays representing inputs, ordered from lowest to highest fidelity. The y_list parameter is a list of numpy arrays representing outputs, also ordered from lowest to highest fidelity. 

The function first checks if the lengths of x_list and y_list are equal, raising a ValueError if they are not. It then checks if the number of points in each fidelity level is the same for both x_list and y_list, raising a ValueError if they are not. 

The x_array returned contains all inputs across all fidelities with the fidelity index appended as the last column. The y_array returned contains all outputs across all fidelities. 

If the function encounters any errors during the conversion process, it will raise appropriate ValueErrors.
