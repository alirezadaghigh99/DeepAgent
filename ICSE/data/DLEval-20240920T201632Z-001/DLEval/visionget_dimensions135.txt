data: Image

prompt:
Generate a Python function called get_dimensions that takes in an image as input and returns the dimensions of the image as a list of integers in the format [channels, height, width]. The input parameter is img, which can be a PIL Image or a Tensor. If the input is a Tensor, the function calls F_t.get_dimensions to get the dimensions. If the input is a PIL Image, the function calls F_pil.get_dimensions to get the dimensions. The function also logs API usage if not in scripting or tracing mode.
