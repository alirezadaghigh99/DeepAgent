prompt:
Create a Python function get_projective_transform that calculates the projection matrix for a 3D rotation given the center, rotation angles, and scales. The function takes the following parameters:

center: A tensor of shape (B, 3) representing the center of the rotation in the source coordinates (x, y, z).
angles: A tensor of shape (B, 3) containing the rotation angles in degrees for the x, y, and z axes.
scales: A tensor of shape (B, 3) representing the scale factors for the x, y, and z directions.
The function returns a tensor of shape (B, 3, 4) representing the projection matrix for the 3D rotation.Raise an AssertionError if center or angles do not have the expected shape.
Raise an AssertionError if center and angles do not share the same device and dtype.
