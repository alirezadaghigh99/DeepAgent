prompt:
Generate a Python function called `_compute_tf_loss` that calculates the sigmoid cross entropy loss between output logits and labels using TensorFlow. The inputs are tensors of logits and labels with shapes `(batch_size)` or `(batch_size, tasks)`, and the output is a tensor of loss values.

```python
class SigmoidCrossEntropy(Loss):
    def _compute_tf_loss(self, output, labels):
```
