prompt:
Generate a Python function called generate_global_features that takes in a RDKit molecule (mol) and a list of feature generators (features_generators) as input. The function returns an array of global features as a numpy array.

The function loops through the list of feature generators and checks if they are available in the GraphConvConstants.FEATURE_GENERATORS. If a generator is available, it featurizes the molecule using the generator and appends the features to the global_features list. If the molecule has no heavy atoms, it uses a dummy molecule (methane) to determine the length of the features.

The function then converts the global_features list to a numpy array and replaces any NaN values with a specified replace_token value.

The output of the function is the global_features_array, which is a numpy array containing the global features of the input molecule.
