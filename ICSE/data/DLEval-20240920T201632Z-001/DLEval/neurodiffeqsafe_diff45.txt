data: Timeseries

prompt:
Create a Python function safe_diff that computes the derivative of a variable u with respect to another variable t using PyTorch tensors. The function takes the following parameters:

u: A PyTorch tensor representing the dependent variable, with shape (n_samples, 1).
t: A PyTorch tensor representing the independent variable, also with shape (n_samples, 1).
order: An integer specifying the order of the derivative to compute, with a default value of 1.
The function returns the derivative of u with respect to t as a PyTorch tensor.

Error Handling:
Raise a ValueError if either u or t does not have the shape (n_samples, 1).
Raise a ValueError if u and t do not have the same shape.
