prompt:
Create a Python function `encode_jpeg` that encodes an input tensor or list of tensors representing images into JPEG format. The function accepts images in CHW layout and a quality parameter between 1 and 100 to control the output JPEG quality. The output is a tensor or list of tensors containing the raw bytes of the JPEG file(s). The function raises a `ValueError` if the quality is not between 1 and 100 or if an empty list is passed as input.
