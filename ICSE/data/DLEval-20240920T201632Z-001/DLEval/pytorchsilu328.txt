prompt:
Generate a Python function called silu that applies the Sigmoid Linear Unit (SiLU) function, also known as the swish function, element-wise on a given input tensor. The function takes in a tensor input and a boolean inplace parameter which defaults to False. The output is a tensor resulting from applying the SiLU function on the input tensor. The SiLU function is defined as x * sigmoid(x), where sigmoid(x) is the logistic sigmoid function. The function also includes references to research papers where the SiLU function was originally introduced and experimented with. The function utilizes torch functions for handling torch tensors and includes an option for in-place operation.
