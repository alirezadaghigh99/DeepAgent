data: Image

prompt:
Generate a Python function called right_jacobian that computes the right Jacobian of So3. The input is a tensor called vec of shape (B, 3) and the output is a tensor of shape (3, 3) representing the right Jacobian matrix. The function uses vector_to_skew_symmetric_matrix, torch.norm, torch.eye, and matrix multiplication to calculate the right Jacobian matrix.
