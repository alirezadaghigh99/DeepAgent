prompt:
Define a Python function called `_get_splat_kernel_normalization` that takes in a tensor `offsets` and a float `sigma` with a default value of 0.5. If the `sigma` value is less than or equal to 0.0, a ValueError is raised. The function calculates a normalization constant using the formula involving exponential and sum operations on the squared values of the `offsets` tensor. An epsilon value of 0.05 is added to the normalization constant to ensure gradient flow through non-boundary pixels. The function returns a normalized value by dividing (1 + epsilon) by the normalization constant.
