prompt:
Create a Python function called run_5point that computes the essential matrix using Nister's 5-point algorithm. The function should take two tensors of calibrated points from two images and an optional weights tensor. It should validate the input shapes, construct a linear system, apply weights if provided, and solve for the essential matrix, returning a (B, 3, 3) tensor for each batch
