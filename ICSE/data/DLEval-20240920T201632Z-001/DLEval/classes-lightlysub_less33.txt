prompt:
Write a Python function `subloss` for the class `SwaVLoss` that calculates the cross-entropy loss between the predictions and the computed codes. The function should take two tensors `z` (similarity of features and prototypes) and `q` (codes obtained from Sinkhorn iterations) as input and return the cross-entropy loss as a `torch.Tensor`. Here is the class structure:

```python
class SwaVLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(
        self,
        temperature: float = 0.1,
        sinkhorn_iterations: int = 3,
        sinkhorn_epsilon: float = 0.05,
        sinkhorn_gather_distributed: bool = False,
    ):
        super(SwaVLoss, self).__init__()
        self.temperature = temperature
        self.sinkhorn_iterations = sinkhorn_iterations
        self.sinkhorn_epsilon = sinkhorn_epsilon
        self.sinkhorn_gather_distributed = sinkhorn_gather_distributed

    def subloss(self, z: torch.Tensor, q: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
```
