prompt:
Generate a Python function called johnson_lindenstrauss_min_dim that calculates the minimum number of components needed to guarantee a distortion rate within a specified range for a random projection. The function takes in the number of samples (n_samples) as an integer or array-like input and the maximum distortion rate (eps) as a float or array-like input. It returns the minimal number of components required to ensure an eps-embedding with good probability for the given number of samples. The function also includes references to the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma and provides examples of usage.
