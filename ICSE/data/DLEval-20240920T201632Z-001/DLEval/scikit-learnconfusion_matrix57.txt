prompt:
Generate a Python function called confusion_matrix that Compute confusion matrix to evaluate the accuracy of a classification.

    By definition a confusion matrix :math:`C` is such that :math:`C_{i, j}`
    is equal to the number of observations known to be in group :math:`i` and
    predicted to be in group :math:`j`.

    Thus in binary classification, the count of true negatives is
    :math:`C_{0,0}`, false negatives is :math:`C_{1,0}`, true positives is
    :math:`C_{1,1}` and false positives is :math:`C_{0,1}`.


    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Ground truth (correct) target values.

    y_pred : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Estimated targets as returned by a classifier.

    labels : array-like of shape (n_classes), default=None
        List of labels to index the matrix. This may be used to reorder
        or select a subset of labels.
        If ``None`` is given, those that appear at least once
        in ``y_true`` or ``y_pred`` are used in sorted order.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

        .. versionadded:: 0.18

    normalize : {'true', 'pred', 'all'}, default=None
        Normalizes confusion matrix over the true (rows), predicted (columns)
        conditions or all the population. If None, confusion matrix will not be
        normalized.

    Returns
    -------
    C : ndarray of shape (n_classes, n_classes)
        Confusion matrix whose i-th row and j-th
        column entry indicates the number of
        samples with true label being i-th class
        and predicted label being j-th class.
