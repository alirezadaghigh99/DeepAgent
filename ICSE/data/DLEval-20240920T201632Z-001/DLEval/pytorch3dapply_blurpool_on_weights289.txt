prompt:
Generate a Python function called apply_blurpool_on_weights that filters weights with a 2-tap max filter followed by a 2-tap blur filter, producing a wide and smooth upper envelope on the weights. The input is a tensor called weights of shape `(..., dim)` and the output is a tensor called blured_weights of the same shape `(..., dim)`. The function pads the weights, applies max pooling, and then performs linear interpolation to create the blurred weights.
