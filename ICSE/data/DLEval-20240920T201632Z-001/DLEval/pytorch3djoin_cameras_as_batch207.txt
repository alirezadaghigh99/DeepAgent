stage: Model Construction
task: 
data: Image

prompt:
Create a Python function `join_cameras_as_batch` that:

- Takes a list of camera objects (`cameras_list`), all of the same type and on the same device.
- Concatenates the tensor attributes of these cameras along the batch dimension to create a single batched camera object.
- Returns the batched camera object, which is of the same type as the input cameras.

Errors:
- Raises `ValueError` if any camera in `cameras_list` does not inherit from `CamerasBase`.
- Raises `ValueError` if the cameras are not of the same type.
- Raises `ValueError` if the cameras are not on the same device.
- Raises `ValueError` if any attribute is inconsistently present across cameras or if the attributes are not compatible for batching.
