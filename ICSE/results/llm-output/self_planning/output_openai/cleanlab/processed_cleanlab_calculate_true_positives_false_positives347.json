This is used to determine how well a predicted bounding box matches a ground truth bounding box.\n\n- **True Positives and False Positives**: For each predicted bounding box, the function calculates the IoU with all ground truth bounding boxes. If the highest IoU is above the threshold, the prediction is considered a true positive. Otherwise, it is a false positive.\n\n- **False Negatives**: If `return_false_negative` is `True`, the function also checks which ground truth boxes were not matched by any prediction with an IoU above the threshold, marking them as false negatives.\n\nThis function provides a comprehensive evaluation of detection performance by calculating true positives, false positives, and optionally false negatives, which are crucial metrics in object detection tasks.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called _calculate_true_positives_false_positives that calculates true positives (TP) and false positives (FP) for object detection tasks. The function takes in predicted bounding boxes (pred_bboxes) and ground truth bounding boxes (lab_bboxes) as numpy arrays, along with an optional Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold (iou_threshold) set to 0.5 by default. Additionally, there is a boolean parameter return_false_negative which, if set to True, will also return an array of False negatives.\n\nThe function initializes arrays for true positives and false positives based on the shapes of the input bounding boxes. It then calculates the IoU values between the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes and determines the true positives and false positives based on the IoU threshold. If there are no ground truth bounding boxes, all predictions are considered false positives.\n\nIf return_false_negative is True, the function also calculates false negatives and returns them along with true positives and false positives. Otherwise, it returns only true positives and false positives.\n\nOverall, the function provides a comprehensive evaluation of the detection performance by calculating true positives, false positives, and optionally false negatives.",
