    "result": "The provided implementation of the softmax function in Python is well-structured and follows the outlined steps. Let's go through the function to ensure it meets all the requirements and provides a clear understanding of each step:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef softmax(x: np.ndarray, temperature: float = 1.0, axis: int = None, shift: bool = True) -> np.ndarray:\n    # Validate temperature\n    if temperature <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Temperature must be a positive float.\")\n    \n    # Shift the input array to prevent overflow\n    if shift:\n        x_max = np.max(x, axis=axis, keepdims=True)\n        x = x - x_max\n    \n    # Scale by temperature\n    x = x / temperature\n    \n    # Compute exponentials\n    exp_x = np.exp(x)\n    \n    # Normalize to get softmax probabilities\n    sum_exp_x = np.sum(exp_x, axis=axis, keepdims=True)\n    softmax_probs = exp_x / sum_exp_x\n    \n    return softmax_probs\n```\n\n### Explanation of Each Step:\n\n1. **Input Validation and Preparation**:\n   - The function checks if the `temperature` is a positive float. This is crucial because a non-positive temperature would not make sense in the context of scaling the input values.\n\n2. **Shift the Input (if required)**:\n   - If `shift` is `True`, the function subtracts the maximum value along the specified axis from each element in `x`. This step is important to prevent numerical overflow when computing the exponential of large numbers, which can lead to infinity values.\n\n3. **Apply Temperature Scaling**:\n   - The input array `x` is divided by the `temperature`. This scaling affects the sensitivity of the softmax function. A higher temperature results in a more uniform distribution, while a lower temperature makes the distribution more peaked.\n\n4. **Compute Exponentials**:\n   - The exponential function is applied to each element of the scaled (and possibly shifted) input array. This step transforms the input values into a non-linear space where they can be normalized.\n\n5. **Normalize to Get Softmax Probabilities**:\n   - The sum of the exponentials is computed along the specified axis. Each exponential value is then divided by this sum to obtain the softmax probabilities. This normalization ensures that the output probabilities sum to 1 along the specified axis.\n\n6. **Return the Result**:\n   - The function returns the resulting numpy array containing the softmax probabilities.\n\nThis implementation is efficient and handles potential numerical issues effectively. It is flexible, allowing the user to specify the axis for the softmax operation, adjust the temperature, and decide whether to apply the shifting technique.",
