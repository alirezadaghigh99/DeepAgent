    "result": "Let's implement the `issues_from_scores` function based on the provided plan. This function will help identify mislabeled pixels or images based on label quality scores and a user-defined threshold. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import Optional\n\ndef issues_from_scores(image_scores: np.ndarray, \n                       pixel_scores: Optional[np.ndarray], \n                       threshold: float) -> np.ndarray:\n    # Step 1: Validate Inputs\n    if image_scores is None:\n        raise ValueError(\"image_scores cannot be None.\")\n    if threshold is None or not (0 <= threshold <= 1):\n        raise ValueError(\"threshold must be a float between 0 and 1.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Identify Issues\n    if pixel_scores is not None:\n        # Create a boolean mask for pixel-level issues\n        issues_mask = pixel_scores < threshold\n        return issues_mask\n    else:\n        # Identify image indices where image_scores are below the threshold\n        issues_indices = np.where(image_scores < threshold)[0]\n        return issues_indices\n\n# Example usage:\n# image_scores = np.array([0.9, 0.4, 0.8, 0.3])\n# pixel_scores = np.random.rand(4, 5, 5)  # Example pixel scores\n# threshold = 0.5\n\n# result = issues_from_scores(image_scores, pixel_scores, threshold)\n# print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Validate Inputs**: \n   - The function first checks if `image_scores` is `None` and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n   - It also checks if `threshold` is `None` or outside the range [0, 1] and raises a `ValueError` if so.\n\n2. **Identify Issues**:\n   - If `pixel_scores` is provided, the function creates a boolean mask where each pixel is marked as `True` if its score is below the threshold.\n   - If `pixel_scores` is not provided, the function identifies the indices of images where the `image_scores` are below the threshold.\n\n3. **Return Results**:\n   - The function returns either the boolean mask or the array of image indices, depending on whether `pixel_scores` is provided.\n\nThis function is designed to be flexible, handling both image-level and pixel-level quality assessments based on the provided scores and threshold.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `issues_from_scores` that identifies mislabeled pixels or images based on label quality scores and a user-defined `threshold`. The function should accept:\n\n- `image_scores` (np.ndarray): Array of shape `(N,)` for image scores.\n- `pixel_scores` (Optional[np.ndarray]): Optional array of shape `(N, H, W)` for pixel-level scores.\n- `threshold` (float): A value between 0 and 1 that determines which scores are considered issues.\n\nThe function returns:\n\n- A boolean mask (np.ndarray) if `pixel_scores` is provided, marking issues as `True`.\n- An array of image indices (np.ndarray) if `pixel_scores` is not provided, for images below the threshold.\n\nRaise `ValueError` if `image_scores` is `None`, if `threshold` is outside the [0, 1] range, or if `threshold` is `None`.",
