    "result": "The function `flatten_and_preprocess_masks` is designed to handle the transformation of label masks and predicted probabilities, ensuring that they are in a format suitable for further analysis or processing. Let's walk through the implementation step by step:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef flatten_and_preprocess_masks(labels, pred_probs):\n    # Step 1: Flatten the labels array\n    if labels.ndim == 2:\n        # If labels is a 2D array, simply flatten it\n        flattened_labels = labels.flatten()\n    elif labels.ndim == 3:\n        # If labels is a 3D array, flatten it along the last two dimensions\n        flattened_labels = labels.reshape(-1)\n    else:\n        # Raise an error if labels is not 2D or 3D\n        raise ValueError(\"Labels array must be 2D or 3D.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Ensure pred_probs is a 4D array\n    if pred_probs.ndim != 4:\n        raise ValueError(\"pred_probs must be a 4D array with shape (B, C, H, W).\")\n\n    # Step 3: Transpose pred_probs to shape (B, H, W, C)\n    pred_probs_transposed = np.transpose(pred_probs, (0, 2, 3, 1))\n\n    # Step 4: Flatten the spatial dimensions (H, W) for each batch\n    B, H, W, C = pred_probs_transposed.shape\n    processed_pred_probs = pred_probs_transposed.reshape(B * H * W, C)\n\n    # Step 5: Return the processed arrays\n    return flattened_labels, processed_pred_probs\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Flattening the `labels` Array**:\n   - If `labels` is a 2D array, it is directly flattened using `flatten()`.\n   - If `labels` is a 3D array, it is reshaped into a 1D array using `reshape(-1)`, which flattens all dimensions.\n\n2. **Handling `pred_probs`**:\n   - The function checks if `pred_probs` is a 4D array. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n   - The array is transposed from shape `(B, C, H, W)` to `(B, H, W, C)` to bring the channels to the last dimension. This is done using `np.transpose(pred_probs, (0, 2, 3, 1))`.\n\n3. **Reshaping `pred_probs`**:\n   - After transposing, the spatial dimensions `(H, W)` are flattened for each batch, resulting in a shape of `(B * H * W, C)`. This is achieved using `reshape(B * H * W, C)`.\n\n4. **Returning the Results**:\n   - The function returns the `flattened_labels` and `processed_pred_probs`, which are now aligned for further processing.\n\nThis function is useful in scenarios where you need to align label data with prediction probabilities, such as in machine learning tasks involving image segmentation or classification.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `flatten_and_preprocess_masks` that flattens a 2D/3D `labels` array and reshapes a 4D `pred_probs` array so that the channels align with the flattened labels. Return the flattened `labels` and the transposed, flattened `pred_probs`.",
