    "result": "Let's focus on implementing the `exponential_moving_average` function as described in your request. This function will calculate the exponential moving average (EMA) for a given array of scores. Here's how you can implement it in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef exponential_moving_average(s, alpha=0.5, axis=None, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the exponential moving average (EMA) of an array of scores.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - s: np.ndarray, the array of scores.\n    - alpha: float, the forgetting factor that gives more weight to the most recent scores.\n    - axis: int, the axis along which the scores are sorted.\n    - kwargs: additional keyword arguments.\n\n    Returns:\n    - s_ema: np.ndarray, the exponential moving average score.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure the input is a numpy array\n    s = np.asarray(s)\n    \n    # If axis is specified, move it to the first axis\n    if axis is not None:\n        s = np.moveaxis(s, axis, 0)\n    \n    # Initialize the EMA array with the same shape as s\n    s_ema = np.zeros_like(s)\n    \n    # Set the first value of EMA to the first score\n    s_ema[0] = s[0]\n    \n    # Calculate the EMA for each subsequent score\n    for t in range(1, s.shape[0]):\n        s_ema[t] = alpha * s[t] + (1 - alpha) * s_ema[t - 1]\n    \n    # If axis was specified, move it back to its original position\n    if axis is not None:\n        s_ema = np.moveaxis(s_ema, 0, axis)\n    \n    return s_ema\n\n# Example usage\ns = np.array([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]])\nresult = exponential_moving_average(s, alpha=0.5)\nprint(result)  # Output: [[0.1  0.15 0.225]]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The function takes an array `s`, a forgetting factor `alpha`, and an optional `axis` parameter. The `axis` parameter allows you to specify along which axis the EMA should be calculated.\n\n2. **Axis Management**: If an axis is specified, the function moves that axis to the front to simplify the calculation. After computing the EMA, it moves the axis back to its original position.\n\n3. **EMA Calculation**: The function initializes the EMA with the first score and iteratively applies the EMA formula to compute the subsequent values.\n\n4. **Output**: The function returns the computed EMA scores as a numpy array.\n\nThis implementation should work for both 1D and multi-dimensional arrays, allowing you to specify the axis along which to compute the EMA.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called exponential_moving_average that calculates the exponential moving average (EMA) score aggregation for a given array of scores. The function takes in an array of scores 's', an optional parameter 'alpha' which determines the weight of the previous EMA score, an integer 'axis' indicating the axis along which the scores are sorted, and additional keyword arguments.\n\nThe EMA is calculated using the formula: EMA_t = alpha * s_t + (1 - alpha) * EMA_{t-1}, where alpha is the forgetting factor that gives more weight to the most recent scores. The function returns the exponential moving average score 's_ema'.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nfrom cleanlab.internal.multilabel_scorer import exponential_moving_average\nimport numpy as np\n\ns = np.array([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]])\nexponential_moving_average(s, alpha=0.5)\n# Output: np.array([0.175])\n```",
