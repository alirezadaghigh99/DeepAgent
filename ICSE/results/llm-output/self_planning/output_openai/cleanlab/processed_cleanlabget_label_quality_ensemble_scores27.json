Note that many parts of the implementation, such as the actual logic for JPEG encoding, DCT, and label quality scoring, are placeholders. You would need to replace these placeholders with the actual logic based on your specific requirements and data.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called get_label_quality_ensemble_scores that calculates label quality scores based on predictions from an ensemble of models. The function takes in the following parameters:\n\n- labels: a numpy array containing the labels for the dataset.\n- pred_probs_list: a list of numpy arrays, where each array represents the predicted probabilities from one model in the ensemble.\n- method: a string indicating the label quality scoring method to use.\n- adjust_pred_probs: a boolean indicating whether to adjust the predicted probabilities.\n- weight_ensemble_members_by: a string indicating the weighting scheme to aggregate scores from each model.\n- custom_weights: a numpy array of custom weights if using the \"custom\" weighting scheme.\n- log_loss_search_T_values: a list of float values for log loss search.\n- verbose: a boolean indicating whether to print statements.\n\nThe function computes label quality scores for each model's predicted probabilities and aggregates them based on the chosen weighting scheme. The output is a numpy array containing one score (between 0 and 1) per example, where lower scores indicate more likely mislabeled examples.",
