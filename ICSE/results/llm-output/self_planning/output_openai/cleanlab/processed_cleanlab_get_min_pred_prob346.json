    "result": "Let's focus on implementing the `_get_min_pred_prob` function as described in your request. This function will take a list of NumPy arrays, each representing predictions, and return the minimum prediction probability from the last column of each array. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef _get_min_pred_prob(predictions):\n    # Initialize pred_probs with a value of 1.0\n    pred_probs = [1.0]\n    \n    # Iterate through each prediction in the input list\n    for prediction in predictions:\n        # Check if the prediction array is not empty\n        if prediction.size > 0:\n            # Extract the last column of the prediction array\n            last_column = prediction[:, -1]\n            # Append these probabilities to the pred_probs list\n            pred_probs.extend(last_column)\n    \n    # Calculate the minimum value in the pred_probs list\n    min_pred_prob = np.min(pred_probs)\n    \n    # Return the minimum prediction probability\n    return min_pred_prob\n\n# Example usage:\n# predictions = [np.array([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]]), np.array([[0.7, 0.8, 0.9]])]\n# print(_get_min_pred_prob(predictions))  # Output should be 0.3\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialize `pred_probs`:** Start with a list containing `1.0` to ensure that `np.min` has a value to operate on, even if no predictions are provided.\n\n2. **Iterate Through Predictions:** For each prediction array, check if it is not empty. If it contains data, extract the last column, which is assumed to contain the prediction probabilities.\n\n3. **Append Probabilities:** Add these extracted probabilities to the `pred_probs` list.\n\n4. **Calculate Minimum Probability:** Use `np.min` to find the minimum value in the `pred_probs` list, which now contains all the prediction probabilities from the last column of each array.\n\n5. **Return the Result:** Return the minimum probability found.\n\nThis function is designed to handle cases where the input list might be empty or contain empty arrays, ensuring robustness in various scenarios.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called _get_min_pred_prob that takes in a list of NumPy arrays called predictions. The function returns a float value which is the minimum prediction probability out of all the predictions in the input list. The function first initializes a list called pred_probs with a value of 1.0 to avoid calling np.min on an empty array. It then iterates through each prediction in the input list, extracts the last column of each class prediction, and appends it to the pred_probs list. Finally, the function calculates the minimum value in the pred_probs list using np.min and returns it as the output.",
