    "result": "Here's a Python function `unsorted_segment_sum` that computes the sum along segments of a tensor, similar to TensorFlow's `tf.unsorted_segment_sum`. The function takes a tensor `data`, a tensor `segment_ids` indicating the segment each element belongs to, and an integer `num_segments` specifying the number of distinct segments. It returns a tensor where each element is the sum of the elements in `data` that belong to the same segment.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef unsorted_segment_sum(data, segment_ids, num_segments):\n    # Ensure data and segment_ids are numpy arrays\n    data = np.array(data)\n    segment_ids = np.array(segment_ids)\n    \n    # Determine the shape of the output tensor\n    output_shape = (num_segments,) + data.shape[1:]\n    \n    # Initialize the output tensor with zeros\n    output = np.zeros(output_shape, dtype=data.dtype)\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in data and its corresponding segment_id\n    for i, segment_id in enumerate(segment_ids):\n        if segment_id < 0 or segment_id >= num_segments:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Segment ID {segment_id} is out of bounds for num_segments {num_segments}.\")\n        output[segment_id] += data[i]\n    \n    return output\n\n# Example usage\ndata = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]])\nsegment_ids = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1])\nnum_segments = 2\n\nresult = unsorted_segment_sum(data, segment_ids, num_segments)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - The function starts by ensuring that `data` and `segment_ids` are NumPy arrays for easy manipulation.\n   - It calculates the shape of the output tensor, which is determined by the number of segments and the remaining dimensions of `data`.\n\n2. **Output Tensor:**\n   - An output tensor is initialized with zeros. Its shape is `(num_segments,) + data.shape[1:]`, which means it has `num_segments` rows and the same number of columns as `data`.\n\n3. **Iteration and Summation:**\n   - The function iterates over each element in `data` and its corresponding `segment_id`.\n   - For each element, it checks if the `segment_id` is within valid bounds. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n   - It adds the element to the appropriate position in the output tensor based on its `segment_id`.\n\n4. **Return:**\n   - Finally, the function returns the output tensor containing the summed values for each segment.\n\nThis implementation provides a straightforward way to compute segment sums, handling both the summation logic and potential errors due to invalid segment IDs.",
