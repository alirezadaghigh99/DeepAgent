    "result": "Certainly! Let's focus on implementing the `_compute_tf_loss` function within the `SoftmaxCrossEntropy` class. This function will calculate the softmax cross-entropy loss between the output logits and the labels using TensorFlow. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n### Implementation of `_compute_tf_loss`\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.losses import Loss\n\nclass SoftmaxCrossEntropy(Loss):\n    def _compute_tf_loss(self, output, labels):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the softmax cross-entropy loss between logits and labels.\n\n        Args:\n            output (tf.Tensor): The output logits with shape (batch_size, classes) or (batch_size, tasks, classes).\n            labels (tf.Tensor): The one-hot encoded labels with the same shape as output.\n\n        Returns:\n            tf.Tensor: A tensor containing the loss values.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Ensure the labels are in the same shape as the output\n        labels = tf.cast(labels, dtype=output.dtype)\n\n        # Compute the softmax cross-entropy loss\n        loss = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=output)\n\n        # If the output is 3D (batch_size, tasks, classes), reduce the loss across the tasks dimension\n        if len(output.shape) == 3:\n            loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss, axis=1)\n\n        return loss\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Input Shapes**: The function handles both 2D and 3D input shapes for `output` and `labels`. The shapes can be `(batch_size, classes)` or `(batch_size, tasks, classes)`.\n\n2. **Casting Labels**: The labels are cast to the same data type as the output logits to ensure compatibility during the loss computation.\n\n3. **Loss Calculation**: The `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` function is used to compute the softmax cross-entropy loss. This function expects the labels to be in a one-hot encoded format.\n\n4. **Handling 3D Outputs**: If the output is 3D, indicating multiple tasks, the loss is averaged across the tasks dimension using `tf.reduce_mean`.\n\n5. **Return**: The function returns a tensor of loss values, which can be used for backpropagation during model training.\n\nThis implementation provides a robust way to compute the softmax cross-entropy loss for both single-task and multi-task scenarios using TensorFlow.",
