    "result": "Here's the implementation of the `_compute_tf_loss` function within the `SigmoidCrossEntropy` class, following the steps you outlined:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.losses import Loss\n\nclass SigmoidCrossEntropy(Loss):\n    def _compute_tf_loss(self, output, labels):\n        # Validate input shapes\n        if output.shape != labels.shape:\n            raise ValueError(\"Output and labels must have the same shape.\")\n        \n        # Compute sigmoid cross-entropy loss\n        loss = tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=output)\n        \n        # Return the loss\n        return loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Import TensorFlow**: We import TensorFlow to utilize its functions, specifically `tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits`, which is designed to compute the sigmoid cross-entropy loss in a numerically stable way.\n\n2. **Define the Function**: The `_compute_tf_loss` function is defined within the `SigmoidCrossEntropy` class, which inherits from `Loss`. This setup is typical in TensorFlow for custom loss functions.\n\n3. **Validate Input Shapes**: Before computing the loss, we check if the shapes of `output` and `labels` are the same. This is crucial because the loss function performs element-wise operations, and mismatched shapes would lead to errors.\n\n4. **Compute Sigmoid Cross-Entropy Loss**: The function `tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits` is used to compute the loss. This function takes logits and labels as inputs and returns the loss for each element. It is specifically designed to handle the numerical stability issues that can arise when computing the sigmoid of logits directly.\n\n5. **Return the Loss**: The computed loss tensor is returned. This tensor can be used in the training loop to update model weights.\n\nThis implementation is efficient and leverages TensorFlow's built-in capabilities to handle the computation of sigmoid cross-entropy loss, making it suitable for binary and multi-label classification tasks.",
