    "result": "Here's the implementation of the `_compute_tf_loss` function within the `L2Loss` class, following the structured approach you outlined:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.losses import Loss\n\nclass L2Loss(Loss):\n    def _compute_tf_loss(self, output, labels):\n        # Ensure the output and labels have the same shape\n        if output.shape != labels.shape:\n            raise ValueError(\"Output and labels must have the same shape.\")\n        \n        # Ensure the output and labels are of float type\n        if not (output.dtype.is_floating and labels.dtype.is_floating):\n            raise TypeError(\"Output and labels must be of float type.\")\n        \n        # Compute the squared differences\n        squared_diff = tf.square(output - labels)\n        \n        # Calculate the L2 loss (mean of squared differences)\n        l2_loss = tf.reduce_mean(squared_diff)\n        \n        return l2_loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Import TensorFlow**: The code begins by importing TensorFlow, which is necessary for using its tensor operations.\n\n2. **Class Definition**: The `L2Loss` class inherits from `Loss`, which is a base class for loss functions in TensorFlow.\n\n3. **Shape and Type Validation**:\n   - The function checks if the `output` and `labels` tensors have the same shape. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n   - It also checks if both tensors are of a floating-point type. If not, it raises a `TypeError`. This ensures that the operations performed are valid for floating-point numbers.\n\n4. **Squared Differences**: The squared difference between the `output` and `labels` tensors is computed using `tf.square(output - labels)`. This operation is element-wise.\n\n5. **L2 Loss Calculation**: The mean of the squared differences is calculated using `tf.reduce_mean(squared_diff)`. This gives the L2 loss, which is essentially the mean squared error.\n\n6. **Return the Loss**: The computed L2 loss is returned as the output of the function.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the L2 loss is calculated correctly and efficiently using TensorFlow, adhering to the requirements specified.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `_compute_tf_loss` for the class `L2Loss` that calculates the L2 loss using TensorFlow. Ensure the shapes of `output` and `labels` are consistent and they are of float type, then compute the squared difference between them.\n\nOutput format:\n\n```python\nclass L2Loss(Loss):\n    def _compute_tf_loss(self, output, labels):\n```",
