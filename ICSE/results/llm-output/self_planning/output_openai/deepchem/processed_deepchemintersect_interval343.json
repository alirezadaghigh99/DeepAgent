    "result": "The `intersect_interval` function you've described is designed to compute the intersection of two intervals, each represented as a tuple of two floats. Let's walk through the implementation step-by-step and ensure it meets the requirements:\n\n1. **Input and Output**:\n   - The function takes two intervals: `interval1` and `interval2`.\n   - Each interval is a tuple of two floats: `(x1_min, x1_max)` and `(x2_min, x2_max)`.\n   - The function returns a tuple representing the intersection of these intervals. If they do not overlap, it returns `(0, 0)`.\n\n2. **Intersection Logic**:\n   - The intersection of two intervals is determined by the maximum of the lower bounds and the minimum of the upper bounds.\n   - The intersection is `(max(x1_min, x2_min), min(x1_max, x2_max))`.\n\n3. **Empty Intersection Check**:\n   - If the calculated intersection has the lower bound greater than the upper bound, the intervals do not overlap, and the intersection is empty.\n   - In such cases, the function returns `(0, 0)`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `intersect_interval` function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\ndef intersect_interval(interval1: Tuple[float, float], interval2: Tuple[float, float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:\n    # Extract the bounds of the intervals\n    x1_min, x1_max = interval1\n    x2_min, x2_max = interval2\n    \n    # Calculate the intersection\n    intersect_min = max(x1_min, x2_min)\n    intersect_max = min(x1_max, x2_max)\n    \n    # Check if the intersection is empty\n    if intersect_min > intersect_max:\n        return (0, 0)\n    \n    # Return the intersection\n    return (intersect_min, intersect_max)\n\n# Example usage:\n# interval1 = (1.0, 5.0)\n# interval2 = (3.0, 7.0)\n# print(intersect_interval(interval1, interval2))  # Output: (3.0, 5.0)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Extracting Bounds**: The function begins by unpacking the bounds of each interval.\n- **Calculating Intersection**: It calculates the potential intersection by finding the maximum of the lower bounds and the minimum of the upper bounds.\n- **Checking for Empty Intersection**: If the lower bound of the intersection is greater than the upper bound, the intervals do not overlap, and the function returns `(0, 0)`.\n- **Returning the Intersection**: If the intervals do overlap, it returns the calculated intersection.\n\nThis implementation efficiently handles the intersection of two intervals and correctly returns an empty set representation when necessary.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called intersect_interavl that Computes the intersection of two intervals.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    interval1: Tuple[float, float]\n        Should be `(x1_min, x1_max)`\n    interval2: Tuple[float, float]\n        Should be `(x2_min, x2_max)`\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    x_intersect: Tuple[float, float]\n        Should be the intersection. If the intersection is empty returns\n        `(0, 0)` to represent the empty set. Otherwise is `(max(x1_min,\n        x2_min), min(x1_max, x2_max))`.",
