    "result": "Here's the implementation of the `_create_pytorch_loss` function within the `L2Loss` class, following the steps you outlined:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass L2Loss(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(L2Loss, self).__init__()\n\n    def _create_pytorch_loss(self, output, labels):\n        # Ensure the shapes of output and labels are consistent\n        if output.shape != labels.shape:\n            raise ValueError(\"Output and labels must have the same shape\")\n\n        # Compute the MSE loss without reduction\n        mse_loss = (output - labels) ** 2\n\n        # Return the computed loss\n        return mse_loss\n\n# Example usage:\n# l2_loss = L2Loss()\n# output = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\n# labels = torch.tensor([1.5, 2.5, 3.5])\n# loss = l2_loss._create_pytorch_loss(output, labels)\n# print(loss)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Shape Consistency Check**: \n   - The function first checks if the `output` and `labels` tensors have the same shape. This is crucial because the element-wise operations that follow require the tensors to be of the same dimensions. If they are not, a `ValueError` is raised with a descriptive message.\n\n2. **MSE Loss Calculation**:\n   - The mean squared error is calculated by taking the element-wise difference between `output` and `labels`, squaring each difference, and storing the result in `mse_loss`. This operation is performed without any reduction, meaning that the result is a tensor of the same shape as the input tensors, containing the squared differences for each corresponding element.\n\n3. **Return the Loss**:\n   - The function returns the `mse_loss` tensor, which contains the squared differences. This allows for further processing or custom aggregation outside the function if needed.\n\nThis implementation is useful when you need to compute the MSE loss for each element individually, without reducing it to a single scalar value, which can be beneficial for certain types of analysis or custom loss functions.",
