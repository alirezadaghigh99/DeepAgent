    "result": "Here's the complete implementation of the `_create_pytorch_loss` function within the `CategoricalCrossEntropy` class, following the steps you outlined:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom torch.nn import Loss\n\nclass CategoricalCrossEntropy(Loss):\n    def _create_pytorch_loss(self, output_probs, labels):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the categorical cross-entropy loss between output probabilities and labels.\n\n        Parameters:\n        - output_probs: Tensor of shape (batch_size, classes) or (batch_size, tasks, classes)\n        - labels: Tensor of shape (batch_size) or (batch_size, tasks)\n\n        Returns:\n        - loss: Tensor of loss values\n        \"\"\"\n        # Check if the output_probs has an extra dimension for tasks\n        if output_probs.dim() == 3:\n            # Reshape the tensors to combine batch_size and tasks into a single dimension\n            batch_size, tasks, classes = output_probs.shape\n            output_probs = output_probs.view(batch_size * tasks, classes)\n            labels = labels.view(batch_size * tasks)\n        \n        # Calculate the cross-entropy loss\n        loss = F.cross_entropy(output_probs, labels)\n        \n        return loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Import Statements**: \n   - `torch` is imported for tensor operations.\n   - `torch.nn.functional` is imported as `F` to access the `cross_entropy` function.\n   - `Loss` is imported from `torch.nn` to define the custom loss class.\n\n2. **Function Definition**:\n   - The `_create_pytorch_loss` method is defined within the `CategoricalCrossEntropy` class, which inherits from `Loss`.\n\n3. **Handling Input Shapes**:\n   - The function checks if `output_probs` has three dimensions, which indicates the presence of multiple tasks.\n   - If so, it reshapes `output_probs` and `labels` to combine the batch size and tasks into a single dimension. This is necessary because `F.cross_entropy` expects inputs of shape `(N, C)`.\n\n4. **Loss Calculation**:\n   - The `F.cross_entropy` function is used to compute the categorical cross-entropy loss. It takes the reshaped `output_probs` and `labels` as inputs.\n\n5. **Return Statement**:\n   - The computed loss tensor is returned.\n\nThis implementation efficiently handles both input shapes and computes the categorical cross-entropy loss using PyTorch's built-in functionality.",
