This ensures that the cosine similarity is computed correctly.\n\n2. **Concatenation**: The normalized outputs are concatenated along the batch dimension to form a single tensor `out`.\n\n3. **Cosine Similarity**: The similarity matrix is computed using matrix multiplication (`torch.mm`). This efficiently calculates the pairwise cosine similarities between all vectors in the batch.\n\n4. **Temperature Scaling**: The similarity matrix is divided by the temperature parameter to control the sharpness of the distribution.\n\n5. **Label Creation**: Labels are created for the positive pairs. Each sample in `out0` is paired with the corresponding sample in `out1`.\n\n6. **Masking**: A mask is applied to the similarity matrix to ignore self-similarities (diagonal elements).\n\n7. **Cross-Entropy Loss**: The cross-entropy loss is computed using the similarity scores and the true labels. The loss encourages high similarity for positive pairs and low similarity for negative pairs.\n\nThis implementation efficiently computes the NT-Xent loss, which is commonly used in contrastive learning tasks to learn representations by maximizing agreement between differently augmented views of the same data point.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `forward` for the `NTXentLoss` class that computes the contrastive cross-entropy loss based on the output projections of two sets of transformed images. The method should normalize the outputs, handle negative samples from the memory bank or within the batch, and calculate the loss using cosine similarity and cross-entropy. The method should return the computed loss.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass NTXentLoss(MemoryBankModule):\n    def __init__(self, temperature: float = 0.5, memory_bank_size: Union[int, Sequence[int]] = 0, gather_distributed: bool = False):\n        self.temperature = temperature\n        self.gather_distributed = gather_distributed\n        self.cross_entropy = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(reduction=\"mean\")\n        self.eps = 1e-8\n        pass\n\n    def forward(self, out0: torch.Tensor, out1: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
