    "result": "To implement the `forward` function for the `SwaVLoss` class, we need to follow the structured approach you outlined. The goal is to compute the SwaV loss by considering both high-resolution and low-resolution outputs, and optionally, queue outputs. Here's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass SwaVLoss(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(SwaVLoss, self).__init__()\n\n    def subloss(self, z: torch.Tensor, q: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        # Returns the cross entropy between predictions z and codes q as a tensor.\n        # Assuming q is a tensor of target indices for cross-entropy\n        return nn.functional.cross_entropy(z, q)\n\n    def forward(self, high_resolution_outputs: List[torch.Tensor], low_resolution_outputs: List[torch.Tensor], queue_outputs: List[torch.Tensor] = None) -> torch.Tensor:\n        total_loss = 0.0\n        num_sublosses = 0\n\n        # Compute sublosses for high-resolution outputs\n        for i, z in enumerate(high_resolution_outputs):\n            q = low_resolution_outputs[i]\n            total_loss += self.subloss(z, q)\n            num_sublosses += 1\n\n            if queue_outputs is not None:\n                q_queue = queue_outputs[i]\n                total_loss += self.subloss(z, q_queue)\n                num_sublosses += 1\n\n        # Compute sublosses for low-resolution outputs\n        for i, z in enumerate(low_resolution_outputs):\n            q = high_resolution_outputs[i]\n            total_loss += self.subloss(z, q)\n            num_sublosses += 1\n\n            if queue_outputs is not None:\n                q_queue = queue_outputs[i]\n                total_loss += self.subloss(z, q_queue)\n                num_sublosses += 1\n\n        # Average the total loss\n        final_loss = total_loss / num_sublosses\n        return final_loss\n```\n\n### Key Considerations:\n\n1. **Subloss Calculation**: The `subloss` method uses `nn.functional.cross_entropy` to compute the cross-entropy loss between predictions `z` and target indices `q`. This assumes that `q` is a tensor of target indices, which is typical for cross-entropy loss.\n\n2. **Queue Outputs**: If `queue_outputs` are provided, they are used to compute additional sublosses. This is optional and handled by checking if `queue_outputs` is not `None`.\n\n3. **Loss Averaging**: The final loss is computed by averaging all the sublosses. This ensures that the loss is normalized by the number of sublosses, which is important for consistent gradient updates during training.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the SwaV loss is computed correctly by considering all possible combinations of high-resolution, low-resolution, and queue outputs.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function `forward` for the class `SwaVLoss` that computes the SwaV loss using high-resolution and low-resolution outputs. The function should handle optional queue outputs and calculate the final loss by averaging sublosses across different views. The function should return the SwaV loss as a `torch.Tensor`. Here is the class structure:\n\n```python\nclass SwaVLoss(nn.Module):\n    def subloss(self, z: torch.Tensor, q: torch.Tensor):\n        # Returns the cross entropy between predictions z and codes q as a tensor.\n    def forward(self, high_resolution_outputs: List[torch.Tensor], low_resolution_outputs: List[torch.Tensor], queue_outputs: List[torch.Tensor] = None) -> torch.Tensor:\n```",
