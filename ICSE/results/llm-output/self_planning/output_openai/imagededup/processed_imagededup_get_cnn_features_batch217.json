    "result": "Here's a detailed implementation of the `_get_cnn_features_batch` method, following the structured approach you outlined:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import PurePath\nfrom typing import Optional, Dict\nimport os\nimport torch\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\nimport torchvision.models as models\nfrom torchvision.datasets import ImageFolder\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\nimport numpy as np\nimport logging\n\ndef _get_cnn_features_batch(image_dir: PurePath, recursive: Optional[bool] = False, num_workers: int = 0) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    # Set up logging\n    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n    \n    # Define image transformations\n    transform = transforms.Compose([\n        transforms.Resize((224, 224)),\n        transforms.ToTensor(),\n        transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),\n    ])\n    \n    # Load images\n    dataset = ImageFolder(root=str(image_dir), transform=transform)\n    data_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=False, num_workers=num_workers)\n    \n    # Load a pre-trained CNN model\n    model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)\n    model.eval()\n    \n    # Initialize the result dictionary\n    features_dict = {}\n    \n    # Process each batch\n    for inputs, _ in data_loader:\n        try:\n            with torch.no_grad():\n                outputs = model(inputs)\n            outputs_np = outputs.numpy()\n            \n            # Map filenames to encodings\n            for i, (path, _) in enumerate(data_loader.dataset.samples):\n                filename = os.path.basename(path)\n                features_dict[filename] = outputs_np[i]\n        \n        except Exception as e:\n            logging.error(f\"Error processing batch: {e}\")\n    \n    return features_dict\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Logging**: The method uses Python's `logging` module to provide information about the process and to log errors encountered during image processing.\n\n2. **Image Transformations**: The images are resized to 224x224 pixels, converted to tensors, and normalized using the mean and standard deviation values typical for models trained on ImageNet.\n\n3. **Data Loading**: The `ImageFolder` class is used to load images from the specified directory. The `DataLoader` handles batching and parallel processing, with the number of workers specified by the `num_workers` parameter.\n\n4. **Model Selection**: A pre-trained ResNet-50 model is used for feature extraction. The model is set to evaluation mode to ensure that it does not update its weights during inference.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: The method includes a try-except block to handle any exceptions that occur during batch processing, logging errors for later review.\n\n6. **Output**: The method returns a dictionary mapping each image's filename to its corresponding CNN encoding, stored as a numpy array.\n\nThis implementation should efficiently process images and handle any issues that arise, providing a robust solution for generating CNN features from a directory of images.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method called `_get_cnn_features_batch` that takes in parameters `image_dir` of type `PurePath`, `recursive` of type `Optional[bool]` with a default value of `False`, and `num_workers` of type `int` with a default value of `0`. The method returns a dictionary mapping filenames to corresponding numpy arrays of CNN encodings.\n\nThe method generates CNN encodings for all images in a given directory of images. It initializes a data loader, processes the images using a model, and creates a dictionary mapping filenames to their respective encodings. The method handles bad images and provides logging information throughout the process.",
