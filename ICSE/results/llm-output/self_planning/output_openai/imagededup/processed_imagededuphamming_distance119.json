    "result": "The function you've outlined is a good approach to calculating the Hamming distance between two hash strings, ensuring they are both treated as 64-bit strings by padding them if necessary. Let's go through the implementation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Input Validation and Preparation**:\n   - Ensure both `hash1` and `hash2` are strings.\n   - Pad each hash to 64 characters with zeros ('0') if they are shorter.\n\n2. **Calculate Hamming Distance**:\n   - Initialize a counter to track differing bits.\n   - Iterate over each character position in the two hash strings.\n   - Increment the counter for each differing character.\n\n3. **Return the Result**:\n   - Return the counter as a float.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\ndef hamming_distance(hash1: str, hash2: str) -> float:\n    # Step 1: Pad the hashes to ensure they are 64 characters long\n    hash1 = hash1.ljust(64, '0')\n    hash2 = hash2.ljust(64, '0')\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the Hamming distance\n    distance = 0\n    for char1, char2 in zip(hash1, hash2):\n        if char1 != char2:\n            distance += 1\n    \n    # Step 3: Return the Hamming distance as a float\n    return float(distance)\n\n# Example usage:\nhash1 = \"1101\"\nhash2 = \"1001\"\nprint(hamming_distance(hash1, hash2))  # Output: 1.0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Padding**: The `ljust(64, '0')` method is used to pad the hash strings to 64 characters by adding zeros to the right if they are shorter than 64 characters.\n  \n- **Hamming Distance Calculation**: The function iterates over each character in the padded strings using `zip`, comparing corresponding characters. If they differ, the `distance` counter is incremented.\n\n- **Return Value**: The function returns the Hamming distance as a float, which is the number of differing characters between the two strings.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the function works correctly even if the input strings are shorter than 64 characters, by padding them appropriately.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called hamming_distance that calculates the Hamming distance between two hash strings. The function takes two input parameters, hash1 and hash2, both of type string. The function returns a float value representing the Hamming distance between the two hashes. If the length of the hashes is not 64 bits, the function pads the length to be 64 for each hash before calculating the Hamming distance. The output is the calculated Hamming distance between the two hashes.",
