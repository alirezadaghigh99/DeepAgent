    "result": "To create the `EncodeImages` class with the `encode_images` method as specified, we need to focus on generating hashes for images in a directory. The method should support recursive directory traversal and multiprocessing for efficiency. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool, cpu_count\nfrom imagededup.methods import PHash  # Assuming PHash is the hash method used\n\nclass EncodeImages:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.hasher = PHash()\n\n    def encode_images(self, image_dir=None, recursive=False, num_enc_workers=cpu_count()):\n        if not image_dir:\n            raise ValueError(\"Image directory must be specified.\")\n\n        # Collect image paths\n        image_paths = []\n        for root, _, files in os.walk(image_dir):\n            for file in files:\n                if file.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg')):\n                    image_paths.append(os.path.join(root, file))\n            if not recursive:\n                break\n\n        # Generate hashes\n        if num_enc_workers > 0:\n            with Pool(num_enc_workers) as pool:\n                hashes = pool.map(self.hasher.encode_image, image_paths)\n        else:\n            hashes = [self.hasher.encode_image(path) for path in image_paths]\n\n        # Create mapping\n        mapping = {os.path.basename(path): hash_str for path, hash_str in zip(image_paths, hashes)}\n\n        return mapping\n\n# Example usage:\n# from imagededup.methods import PHash\n# myencoder = EncodeImages()\n# mapping = myencoder.encode_images('path/to/directory')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `EncodeImages` class initializes with a `PHash` object from the `imagededup` library, which is used to generate perceptual hashes for images.\n\n2. **encode_images Method**:\n   - **Parameters**:\n     - `image_dir`: The directory containing images to be hashed.\n     - `recursive`: If `True`, the method will search for images in subdirectories as well.\n     - `num_enc_workers`: The number of CPU cores to use for parallel processing. Defaults to the number of available CPU cores. If set to 0, multiprocessing is disabled.\n   \n   - **Image Collection**: Uses `os.walk` to traverse the directory and collect image file paths. The traversal can be recursive based on the `recursive` flag.\n\n   - **Hash Generation**: \n     - If `num_enc_workers` is greater than 0, a multiprocessing pool is used to hash images in parallel, which can significantly speed up the process for large datasets.\n     - If `num_enc_workers` is 0, images are hashed sequentially.\n\n   - **Mapping Creation**: A dictionary is created mapping each image's filename to its corresponding hash string.\n\n3. **Example Usage**: Demonstrates how to use the `EncodeImages` class to generate hashes for images in a specified directory.\n\nThis implementation provides a flexible and efficient way to generate image hashes, leveraging both recursive directory traversal and multiprocessing capabilities. Adjustments can be made based on specific requirements or additional context.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python class called encode_images with the following methods:\n- encode_images(self, image_dir=None, recursive: bool = False, num_enc_workers: int = cpu_count())\n\nThe encode_images method generates hashes for all images in a given directory of images. It takes three arguments:\n- image_dir: Path to the image directory.\n- recursive: Optional, find images recursively in a nested image directory structure, set to False by default.\n- num_enc_workers: Optional, number of CPU cores to use for multiprocessing encoding generation, set to the number of CPUs in the system by default. 0 disables multiprocessing.\n\nThe method returns a dictionary that contains a mapping of filenames and corresponding 64-character hash strings, such as {'Image1.jpg': 'hash_string1', 'Image2.jpg': 'hash_string2', ...}\n\nExample usage:\n```\nfrom imagededup.methods import <hash-method>\nmyencoder = <hash-method>()\nmapping = myencoder.encode_images('path/to/directory')\n```",
