    "result": "The provided implementation of the `inverse_transform` function is well-structured and follows the necessary steps to reverse the whitening process. Let's break down the key components and ensure everything is clear:\n\n1. **Precondition Checks**: \n   - The function first checks if the transformation has been fitted by verifying `self.fitted`. If not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.\n   - It then checks if the inverse transformation matrix was computed by verifying `self.compute_inv`. If not, it raises another `RuntimeError`.\n   - Finally, it checks if the inverse transformation matrix (`self.transform_inv`) is available. If it is `None`, a `TypeError` is raised.\n\n2. **Matrix Multiplication**:\n   - The inverse transformation is applied using matrix multiplication. In Python, the `@` operator is used for matrix multiplication, which is supported by libraries like PyTorch and NumPy. This operation effectively reverses the whitening process by applying the inverse of the transformation matrix to the whitened data `x`.\n\n3. **Return Statement**:\n   - The function returns the data after applying the inverse transformation, which should restore the data to its original form before whitening.\n\nHere's the complete function as described:\n\n```python\ndef inverse_transform(self, x: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n    r\"\"\"Apply the inverse transform to the whitened data.\n\n    Args:\n        x: Whitened data.\n\n    Returns:\n        Original data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the transformation has been fitted\n    if not self.fitted:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Needs to be fitted first before running. Please call fit or set include_fit to True.\")\n\n    # Check if the inverse transformation matrix is computed\n    if not self.compute_inv:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Did not compute inverse ZCA. Please set compute_inv to True\")\n\n    # Check if the inverse transformation matrix is available\n    if self.transform_inv is None:\n        raise TypeError(\"The transform inverse should be a Tensor. Gotcha None.\")\n\n    # Apply the inverse transformation\n    original_data = x @ self.transform_inv\n\n    # Return the original data\n    return original_data\n```\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Data Type**: Ensure that `x` and `self.transform_inv` are of compatible types (e.g., PyTorch Tensors) for matrix multiplication.\n- **Shape Compatibility**: The shapes of `x` and `self.transform_inv` should be compatible for matrix multiplication. Typically, if `x` is of shape `(n_samples, n_features)`, then `self.transform_inv` should be of shape `(n_features, n_features)`.\n- **Numerical Stability**: Depending on the context, you might need to consider numerical stability issues, especially if the transformation matrix is close to singular.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the inverse transformation matrix was correctly computed during the fitting process and stored in `self.transform_inv`.",
