    "result": "The function `triangular_kernel1d` is designed to create a 1D triangular kernel, which is often used in image processing tasks like Local Normalized Cross-Correlation (LNCC). The kernel has a peak in the middle and tapers off symmetrically towards the edges. Let's walk through the implementation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initialize the Kernel**: We start by creating a 1D tensor of zeros with the specified `kernel_size`.\n\n2. **Calculate the Center**: The center index of the kernel is calculated as `kernel_size // 2`. This is where the peak of the triangular kernel will be.\n\n3. **Fill the Kernel**: We populate the kernel with values that increase linearly from the edges towards the center, forming a triangular shape. This is done by creating two sequences: one that increases from 1 to the center value and another that decreases back to 1.\n\n4. **Normalize the Kernel**: Although the weight scale does not matter for LNCC, normalizing the kernel to sum to 1 is a common practice for convolution kernels.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ndef triangular_kernel1d(kernel_size: int) -> tf.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a 1D triangular kernel for LocalNormalizedCrossCorrelation.\n\n    Assume kernel_size is odd, it will be a smoothed from\n    a kernel which center part is zero.\n    Then length of the ones will be around half kernel_size.\n    The weight scale of the kernel does not matter as LNCC will normalize it.\n\n    :param kernel_size: scalar, size of the 1-D kernel\n    :return: kernel_weights, of shape (kernel_size, )\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    assert kernel_size >= 3\n    assert kernel_size % 2 != 0\n\n    # Calculate the center index\n    center = kernel_size // 2\n\n    # Create a linearly increasing sequence from 1 to center+1\n    increasing = tf.range(1, center + 2, dtype=tf.float32)\n\n    # Create a linearly decreasing sequence from center to 1\n    decreasing = tf.range(center, 0, -1, dtype=tf.float32)\n\n    # Concatenate increasing and decreasing sequences to form the triangular shape\n    kernel = tf.concat([increasing, decreasing], axis=0)\n\n    # Normalize the kernel to sum to 1\n    kernel /= tf.reduce_sum(kernel)\n\n    return kernel\n\n# Example usage\nkernel = triangular_kernel1d(5)\nprint(kernel.numpy())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Increasing and Decreasing Sequences**: The `increasing` sequence starts from 1 and goes up to `center + 1`, while the `decreasing` sequence starts from `center` and goes down to 1. This forms the triangular shape.\n- **Concatenation**: These sequences are concatenated to form the full kernel.\n- **Normalization**: The kernel is normalized to ensure it sums to 1, which is a common practice for convolution kernels, although not strictly necessary for LNCC.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the kernel has a symmetric triangular shape, which is useful for smoothing operations in image processing.",
