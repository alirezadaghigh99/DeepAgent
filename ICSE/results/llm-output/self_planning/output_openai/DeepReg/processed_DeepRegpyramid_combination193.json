    "result": "To implement the `pyramid_combination` function, we need to ensure that the inputs are correctly validated and that the interpolation is performed as described. Here's the complete implementation with detailed comments:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef pyramid_combination(values, weight_floor, weight_ceil):\n    # Validate input dimensions\n    n = len(weight_floor)\n    if len(values) != 2**n:\n        raise ValueError(\"The length of values must be 2^n where n is the length of weight_floor and weight_ceil.\")\n    \n    # Check that all weight_floor and weight_ceil have the same shape as values[0]\n    for wf, wc in zip(weight_floor, weight_ceil):\n        if wf.shape != values[0].shape or wc.shape != values[0].shape:\n            raise ValueError(\"All weight_floor and weight_ceil tensors must have the same shape as the elements in values.\")\n    \n    # Initialize the result tensor\n    result = torch.zeros_like(values[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over each corner of the hypercube\n    for i in range(2**n):\n        # Determine the binary representation of the corner index\n        binary_index = [(i >> j) & 1 for j in range(n)]\n        \n        # Compute the weight for this corner\n        weight = torch.ones_like(result)\n        for j in range(n):\n            if binary_index[j] == 0:\n                weight *= weight_floor[j]\n            else:\n                weight *= weight_ceil[j]\n        \n        # Accumulate the weighted value\n        result += values[i] * weight\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# Assuming you have PyTorch tensors for values, weight_floor, and weight_ceil\n# values = [torch.tensor(...), torch.tensor(...), ...]  # 2^n tensors\n# weight_floor = [torch.tensor(...), torch.tensor(...), ...]  # n tensors\n# weight_ceil = [torch.tensor(...), torch.tensor(...), ...]  # n tensors\n# result = pyramid_combination(values, weight_floor, weight_ceil)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Input Validation**: The function checks that the number of `values` matches `2^n`, where `n` is the number of dimensions (length of `weight_floor` and `weight_ceil`). It also ensures that each tensor in `weight_floor` and `weight_ceil` has the same shape as the tensors in `values`.\n\n2. **Binary Representation**: The binary representation of the index `i` is used to determine which weights to use from `weight_floor` and `weight_ceil`.\n\n3. **Weight Calculation**: For each dimension, the function selects either the floor or ceil weight based on the binary index.\n\n4. **Accumulation**: The function accumulates the weighted values to compute the final interpolated result.\n\nThis implementation assumes the use of PyTorch tensors, but it can be adapted to other tensor libraries with similar operations.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `pyramid_combination` that performs linear interpolation based on values at the corners of a hypercube in an n-dimensional space. The function accepts three main inputs: `values` (a list of tensors representing values at the corners), `weight_floor`, and `weight_ceil` (lists of tensors representing the interpolation weights). The function ensures that the shapes of the inputs are compatible, with `values` needing to have a length of `2^n` where `n` is the length of `weight_floor` and `weight_ceil`. It returns a tensor with the same shape as the elements in `values`.\n\nThe function includes error handling to check for mismatched dimensions between `values`, `weight_floor`, and `weight_ceil`, and also validates that the length of `values` matches the expected `2^n` based on the dimension of the weights. If these conditions are not met, the function raises a `ValueError`.",
