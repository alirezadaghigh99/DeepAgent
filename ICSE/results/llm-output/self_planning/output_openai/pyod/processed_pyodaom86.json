    "result": "The `aom` function you provided is a well-structured implementation of the Average of Maximum ensemble method. Let's go through the key components and ensure everything is clear and correct:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function checks if the `scores` input is a 2D numpy array and validates the `n_buckets` and `method` parameters. This is crucial to prevent runtime errors and ensure the function behaves as expected.\n\n2. **Random State Initialization**: The use of `np.random.default_rng(random_state)` is a modern approach to handle random number generation, providing better reproducibility and flexibility compared to older methods.\n\n3. **Subgroup Assignment**:\n   - **Static Method**: The estimators are divided into `n_buckets` subgroups evenly using `np.array_split`. This ensures each subgroup has a roughly equal number of estimators.\n   - **Dynamic Method**: Estimators are randomly assigned to subgroups. The use of `rng.choice` allows for both with and without replacement sampling, controlled by the `bootstrap_estimators` flag.\n\n4. **Score Calculation**:\n   - For each subgroup, the maximum score across the estimators in that subgroup is computed for each sample.\n   - These maximum scores are then averaged across all subgroups to produce the final combined score for each sample.\n\n5. **Return Value**: The function returns the combined scores as a 1D numpy array, representing the ensemble score for each sample.\n\nHere's the complete function again for clarity:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef aom(scores, n_buckets=5, method='static', bootstrap_estimators=False, random_state=None):\n    # Validate inputs\n    if not isinstance(scores, np.ndarray) or scores.ndim != 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Scores must be a 2D numpy array.\")\n    \n    n_samples, n_estimators = scores.shape\n    if n_buckets <= 0 or n_buckets > n_estimators:\n        raise ValueError(\"n_buckets must be a positive integer less than or equal to the number of estimators.\")\n    \n    if method not in ['static', 'dynamic']:\n        raise ValueError(\"Method must be either 'static' or 'dynamic'.\")\n    \n    # Initialize random state\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(random_state)\n    \n    # Determine subgroup indices\n    if method == 'static':\n        # Static method: divide estimators into n_buckets subgroups evenly\n        indices = np.array_split(np.arange(n_estimators), n_buckets)\n    else:\n        # Dynamic method: randomly assign estimators to subgroups\n        if bootstrap_estimators:\n            indices = [rng.choice(n_estimators, n_estimators // n_buckets, replace=True) for _ in range(n_buckets)]\n        else:\n            indices = [rng.choice(n_estimators, n_estimators // n_buckets, replace=False) for _ in range(n_buckets)]\n    \n    # Compute maximum scores for each subgroup\n    max_scores = np.zeros((n_samples, n_buckets))\n    for i, idx in enumerate(indices):\n        max_scores[:, i] = np.max(scores[:, idx], axis=1)\n    \n    # Average the maximum scores\n    combined_scores = np.mean(max_scores, axis=1)\n    \n    return combined_scores\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Flexibility**: The function is flexible, allowing for different methods of subgroup creation and the option to use bootstrapping.\n- **Reproducibility**: The use of a random state ensures that results can be reproduced, which is important for debugging and testing.\n- **Efficiency**: The function efficiently computes the required scores using numpy operations, which are optimized for performance.\n\nThis function should work well for combining outlier scores from multiple estimators using the Average of Maximum method.",
