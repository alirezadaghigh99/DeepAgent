    "result": "The function `_perform_padding` is designed to pad an image so that its height and width are divisible by 16. This is often necessary for certain neural network architectures that require input dimensions to be multiples of a specific number. Let's go through the implementation step-by-step:\n\n### Implementation\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef _perform_padding(image: Tensor) -> tuple[Tensor, int, int]:\n    # Extract the height and width of the image\n    _, _, H, W = image.shape\n    \n    # Calculate the padding needed to make H and W divisible by 16\n    h_pad = (16 - H % 16) % 16\n    w_pad = (16 - W % 16) % 16\n    \n    # Apply padding to the image\n    # Padding is applied as (left, right, top, bottom)\n    image_padded = F.pad(image, (0, w_pad, 0, h_pad), mode='constant', value=0)\n    \n    # Return the padded image and the padding values\n    return image_padded, h_pad, w_pad\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Extract Image Dimensions**: \n   - The function assumes the input image tensor has a shape of `(*, 3, H, W)`, where `*` can be any number of leading dimensions. The height `H` and width `W` are extracted from the image shape.\n\n2. **Calculate Padding**:\n   - The padding required for the height (`h_pad`) is calculated as `(16 - H % 16) % 16`. This ensures that the new height is the smallest multiple of 16 that is greater than or equal to the original height.\n   - Similarly, the padding required for the width (`w_pad`) is calculated.\n\n3. **Apply Padding**:\n   - The `torch.nn.functional.pad` function is used to apply zero padding to the image. The padding is specified as `(left, right, top, bottom)`, so `(0, w_pad, 0, h_pad)` means no padding on the left and top, and `w_pad` and `h_pad` padding on the right and bottom, respectively.\n\n4. **Return Results**:\n   - The function returns the padded image and the padding values for both dimensions. These padding values can be useful if you need to reverse the padding operation later.\n\nThis function is useful for preparing images for processing in neural networks or other systems that require specific input dimensions. The use of zero padding ensures that the added pixels do not introduce any unwanted information into the image.",
