    "result": "The function `_load_image_to_tensor` is designed to load an image from a file, decode it using Kornia's Rust backend, and convert it into a PyTorch tensor. Here's a detailed breakdown of the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport torch\nimport kornia as K\n\ndef _load_image_to_tensor(path_file: Path, device: torch.device) -> torch.Tensor:\n    # Step 1: Check if the file format is supported\n    if not path_file.suffix.lower() in ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.bmp', '.tiff']:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Unsupported image format: {path_file.suffix}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Read and decode the image using Kornia\n    try:\n        # Kornia's image reading function (assuming Kornia has a function for this)\n        image = K.io.load_image(str(path_file), K.io.ImageLoadType.RGB8)\n    except Exception as e:\n        raise RuntimeError(f\"Failed to load image: {e}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Convert the image to a PyTorch tensor\n    # Ensure the image is in the format (3, H, W)\n    if image.ndim != 3 or image.shape[0] != 3:\n        raise ValueError(\"Decoded image is not in the expected format (3, H, W)\")\n\n    # Step 4: Move the tensor to the specified device\n    image_tensor = image.to(device)\n\n    # Step 5: Return the tensor\n    return image_tensor\n```\n\n### Key Considerations:\n\n1. **Supported Formats**: The function checks if the file extension is one of the supported formats (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.bmp`, `.tiff`). If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Image Decoding**: The function uses Kornia's `load_image` function to read and decode the image. This assumes that Kornia has a function `load_image` that can handle the specified image formats and convert them to RGB format.\n\n3. **Tensor Shape**: After decoding, the function checks if the image tensor has three dimensions and that the first dimension (channels) is 3, ensuring the format is `(3, H, W)`.\n\n4. **Device Management**: The function moves the tensor to the specified device (CPU or GPU) using `to(device)`, which is crucial for compatibility with the user's hardware setup.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: The function raises a `RuntimeError` if the image cannot be loaded, providing a clear error message.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- **Kornia's API**: Ensure that Kornia's API supports the operations as expected. The function assumes Kornia has a `load_image` function that can handle the specified formats and convert them to RGB. If Kornia's API changes, adjustments may be necessary.\n\n- **Dependencies**: Ensure that both Kornia and PyTorch are installed in your environment, as they are required for this function to work.\n\nThis function provides a robust way to load images into PyTorch tensors, leveraging Kornia's capabilities for image processing.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function `_load_image_to_tensor` that reads an image file from the specified `path_file`, decodes it using the Kornia Rust backend, and converts it to a PyTorch tensor. The function takes two inputs: `path_file`, which is a `Path` object pointing to a valid image file, and `device`, which specifies the device (e.g., CPU or GPU) where the image tensor should be placed. The function returns the image as a tensor with shape `(3, H, W)`, where `H` is the height and `W` is the width of the image. The function handles image files with `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and other supported formats, raising an error if the image format is unsupported. It also ensures that the resulting tensor is moved to the specified device.",
