    "result": "To implement the function `motion_from_essential_choose_solution`, we need to follow the outlined steps to ensure that we correctly recover the relative camera motion from the essential matrix.

The solution with the maximum number of such points is selected.\n\n6. **Return**: The function returns the best rotation matrix, translation vector, and the triangulated 3D points.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input points are in homogeneous coordinates and that the camera matrices are correctly defined. Adjustments may be needed based on specific input formats or additional constraints.",
    "prompt": "Create a function `motion_from_essential_choose_solution` that recovers the relative camera rotation and translation from an estimated essential matrix `E_mat`. The function checks corresponding points in two images using the camera matrices `K1` and `K2` and returns the best solution along with the triangulated 3D points. Input tensors include the essential matrix (`E_mat`), camera matrices (`K1`, `K2`), and point sets (`x1`, `x2`). An optional `mask` can exclude points from choosing the best solution. The function returns a tuple containing the rotation matrix, translation vector, and 3D points. Errors are raised for incorrect input shapes, and batch dimensions are handled appropriately.",
