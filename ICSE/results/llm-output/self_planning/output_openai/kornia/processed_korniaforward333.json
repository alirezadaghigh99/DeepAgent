    "result": "The implementation of the `forward` function for the `STEFunction` class is designed to facilitate the Straight-Through Estimation (STE) process by treating the function as an identity function during the forward pass. Here's the complete implementation of the `forward` function:\n\n```python\nfrom torch.autograd import Function\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom typing import Any, Optional, Callable\n\nclass STEFunction(Function):\n    \"\"\"Straight-Through Estimation (STE) function.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def forward(ctx: Any, input: Tensor, output: Tensor, grad_fn: Optional[Callable[..., Any]] = None) -> Tensor:\n        # Store the gradient function in the context for use in the backward pass\n        ctx.grad_fn = grad_fn\n        # Return the output as is, since STE acts as an identity function in the forward pass\n        return output\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Context Storage**: \n   - The `ctx` object is used to store the `grad_fn` (if provided) for use during the backward pass. This allows the backward function to apply any custom gradient transformations specified by `grad_fn`.\n\n2. **Identity Forward Pass**:\n   - The forward function returns the `output` tensor directly. This is because the STE function is intended to act as an identity function during the forward pass, allowing the original output to be used without modification.\n\n3. **Gradient Function Handling**:\n   - While the `grad_fn` is not directly used in the forward function, it is crucial for the backward pass. The backward function (not shown here) will utilize `grad_fn` to potentially modify the gradients, enabling custom gradient behavior.\n\nThis setup ensures that the `STEFunction` can correctly handle the forward pass while preparing for any necessary gradient modifications during the backward pass.",
    "prompt": "Write the forward function for following class : \nclass STEFunction(Function):\n    \"\"\"Straight-Through Estimation (STE) function.\n\n    STE bridges the gradients between the input tensor and output tensor as if the function\n    was an identity function. Meanwhile, advanced gradient functions are also supported. e.g.\n    the output gradients can be mapped into [-1, 1] with ``F.hardtanh`` function.\n\n    Args:\n        grad_fn: function to restrain the gradient received. If None, no mapping will performed.\n\n    Example:\n        Let the gradients of ``torch.sign`` estimated from STE.\n        >>> input = torch.randn(4, requires_grad = True)\n        >>> output = torch.sign(input)\n        >>> loss = output.mean()\n        >>> loss.backward()\n        >>> input.grad\n        tensor([0., 0., 0., 0.])\n\n        >>> with torch.no_grad():\n        ...     output = torch.sign(input)\n        >>> out_est = STEFunction.apply(input, output)\n        >>> loss = out_est.mean()\n        >>> loss.backward()\n        >>> input.grad\n        tensor([0.2500, 0.2500, 0.2500, 0.2500])\n    \"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def forward(ctx: Any, input: Tensor, output: Tensor, grad_fn: Optional[Callable[..., Any]] = None) -> Tensor:",
