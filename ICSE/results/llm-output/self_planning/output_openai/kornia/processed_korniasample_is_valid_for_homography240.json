    "result": "To implement the `sample_is_valid_for_homography` function, we will follow the outlined steps to ensure that the function checks the validity of a sample for homography estimation using the oriented constraint check from Marquez-Neila2015.

If not, we raise a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Convert to Homogeneous Coordinates**: We convert the 2D points to homogeneous coordinates by appending a 1 to each point.\n\n3. **Determine Validity**: We use the oriented constraint check, which involves computing the cross product of corresponding points in homogeneous coordinates. The cross product's z-component is used to determine the orientation. A valid sample should have consistent orientation across all point pairs.\n\n4. **Return Validity Mask**: We return a boolean mask indicating whether each batch is valid for homography estimation.\n\nThis function will help in determining if a given set of point correspondences is suitable for estimating a homography matrix.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called sample_is_valid_for_homography that implements the oriented constraint check from Marquez-Neila2015. The function takes two input tensors, points1 and points2, each with a shape of (B, 4, 2), where B is the batch size. The function returns a mask with the minimal sample that is good for homography estimation, with a shape of (B, 3, 3). The function first checks if the shapes of points1 and points2 are equal, then converts the points to homogeneous coordinates. and finally determines if the sample is valid for homography estimation. The output is a tensor representing the validity of the sample for each batch.",
