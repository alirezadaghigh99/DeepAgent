    "result": "To implement the `get_sobel_kernel2d_2nd_order` function, we need to follow the outlined steps. This function will generate a set of 2nd-order Sobel kernels for edge detection. Let's assume that the helper functions `get_sobel_kernel_5x5_2nd_order` and `_get_sobel_kernel_5x5_2nd_order_xy` are already defined and available for use. Here's how you can implement the function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef get_sobel_kernel2d_2nd_order(device=None, dtype=None):\n    # Step 1: Obtain the 5x5 2nd-order Sobel kernel for the second derivative in the x-direction (gxx)\n    gxx = get_sobel_kernel_5x5_2nd_order()\n    \n    # Step 2: Transpose this kernel to obtain the kernel for the second derivative in the y-direction (gyy)\n    gyy = gxx.T\n    \n    # Step 3: Obtain the mixed partial derivative kernel (gxy)\n    gxy = _get_sobel_kernel_5x5_2nd_order_xy()\n    \n    # Step 4: Stack the gxx, gxy, and gyy kernels into a single tensor\n    kernels = torch.stack([gxx, gxy, gyy], dim=0)\n    \n    # Step 5: Move the tensor to the specified device and dtype if provided\n    if device is not None:\n        kernels = kernels.to(device)\n    if dtype is not None:\n        kernels = kernels.to(dtype)\n    \n    # Step 6: Return the stacked tensor\n    return kernels\n\n# Example usage:\n# Assuming the helper functions are defined, you can call the function like this:\n# kernels = get_sobel_kernel2d_2nd_order(device='cpu', dtype=torch.float32)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Obtain 5x5 2nd-order Sobel Kernel**: We call `get_sobel_kernel_5x5_2nd_order()` to get the kernel for the second derivative in the x-direction (`gxx`).\n\n2. **Transpose for y-direction**: We transpose `gxx` to obtain `gyy`, which is the kernel for the second derivative in the y-direction.\n\n3. **Obtain Mixed Partial Derivative Kernel**: We call `_get_sobel_kernel_5x5_2nd_order_xy()` to get the mixed partial derivative kernel (`gxy`).\n\n4. **Stack Kernels**: We use `torch.stack` to stack `gxx`, `gxy`, and `gyy` into a single tensor along a new dimension.\n\n5. **Return Stacked Tensor**: The function returns the stacked tensor, optionally moving it to the specified device and dtype.\n\nThis function assumes that the helper functions `get_sobel_kernel_5x5_2nd_order` and `_get_sobel_kernel_5x5_2nd_order_xy` are implemented elsewhere in your codebase. If you need help implementing those functions, please let me know!",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function get_sobel_kernel2d_2nd_order that generates a set of 2nd-order Sobel kernels for edge detection.
