It raises appropriate errors if these conditions are not met.\n\n2. **Prepare Input:** The function ensures the input tensor is in the correct shape, adding a batch dimension if necessary.\n\n3. **Divide the Image into Tiles:** The function calculates the size of each tile based on the image dimensions and the specified grid size.\n\n4. **Compute Histograms and Apply CLAHE:** For each tile, the function computes the histogram, applies contrast limiting if `clip_limit` is greater than zero, and creates a lookup table (LUT) to map the original pixel values to the equalized values.\n\n5. **Interpolate Between Tiles:** The function reconstructs the equalized image by applying the LUT to each tile.\n\n6. **Handle Batch Processing:** The function processes each image in the batch and ensures the output shape matches the input shape.\n\nThis implementation provides a basic framework for applying CLAHE to image tensors. Note that this implementation is not optimized for speed and does not include a differentiable version, as that would require a more complex approach involving custom autograd functions or using libraries that support differentiable operations.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `equalize_clahe` that applies Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to an input image tensor. The function should accept the following parameters:\n- `input`: A tensor representing one or more images, with values in the range [0, 1] and shape \\((*, C, H, W)\\), where \\(*\\) can include any number of batch dimensions.\n- `clip_limit`: A float that sets the threshold for contrast limiting. If set to 0, clipping is disabled.\n- `grid_size`: A tuple of two integers specifying the number of tiles to divide the image into in each direction.\n- `slow_and_differentiable`: A boolean flag to select an implementation that is slow but differentiable.\n\nThe function returns an image tensor with the same shape as the input after applying CLAHE.\n\n### Error Handling:\n- Raise a `TypeError` if `clip_limit` is not a float.\n- Raise a `TypeError` if `grid_size` is not a tuple of two integers.\n- Raise a `ValueError` if any element of `grid_size` is non-positive.\n\nThe function divides the input image into tiles, computes histograms for each tile, applies CLAHE using lookup tables (LUTs), and then reconstructs the equalized image by interpolating between the tiles. The function should handle batch processing and ensure the output is correctly shaped, even if the input was not in batch form. This function is useful in image processing tasks where enhancing the contrast of images is necessary, particularly in fields like computer vision or medical imaging.",
