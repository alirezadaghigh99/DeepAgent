    "result": "Let's implement the `total_variation` function based on the provided plan. This function will compute the Total Variation of an input image tensor, which is a measure of the amount of variation or \"noise\" in the image. The function will handle error checking for input types and reduction options.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef total_variation(image_tensor, reduction='sum'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the Total Variation of an input image tensor.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - image_tensor (torch.Tensor): The input image tensor with shape (*, H, W).\n    - reduction (str): Specifies the reduction method, either 'sum' or 'mean'.\n\n    Returns:\n    - torch.Tensor: A tensor with shape (*) representing the total variation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Validate input type\n    if not isinstance(image_tensor, torch.Tensor):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a torch.Tensor\")\n\n    # Validate reduction parameter\n    if reduction not in ['sum', 'mean']:\n        raise ValueError(\"Reduction must be either 'sum' or 'mean'\")\n\n    # Compute differences along the height and width dimensions\n    diff_h = torch.abs(image_tensor[..., 1:, :] - image_tensor[..., :-1, :])\n    diff_w = torch.abs(image_tensor[..., :, 1:] - image_tensor[..., :, :-1])\n\n    # Sum the differences to get the total variation\n    total_var = diff_h.sum(dim=(-2, -1)) + diff_w.sum(dim=(-2, -1))\n\n    # Apply reduction\n    if reduction == 'mean':\n        num_elements = image_tensor.shape[-2] * image_tensor.shape[-1]\n        total_var = total_var / num_elements\n\n    return total_var\n\n# Example usage:\n# image_tensor = torch.rand((3, 256, 256))  # Example image tensor\n# tv = total_variation(image_tensor, reduction='mean')\n# print(tv)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Validate Input:**\n   - The function first checks if the input is a `torch.Tensor`. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n   - It also checks if the `reduction` parameter is either 'sum' or 'mean'. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Compute Total Variation:**\n   - The function calculates the absolute differences between neighboring pixels along the height (`H`) and width (`W`) dimensions using `torch.abs`.\n   - It computes the sum of these differences to get the total variation.\n\n3. **Apply Reduction:**\n   - If the `reduction` parameter is 'mean', the function divides the total variation by the number of elements in the height and width dimensions to get the average variation.\n\n4. **Return Result:**\n   - The function returns the computed total variation tensor.\n\nThis implementation should work for any image tensor with shape `(*, H, W)`, where `*` can be any number of leading dimensions.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called total_variation that computes the Total Variation of an input image tensor. The function takes in an image tensor with shape (*, H, W) and an optional reduction parameter that specifies whether to return the sum or mean of the output. The function returns a tensor with shape (*). The Total Variation is calculated by taking the absolute differences of neighboring pixels in the image tensor along the height and width dimensions. The output is then either summed or averaged based on the reduction parameter. The function includes error checking for input types and reduction options.",
