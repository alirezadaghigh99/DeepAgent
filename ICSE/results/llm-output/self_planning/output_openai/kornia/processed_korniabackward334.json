    "result": "The `backward` function for the `STEFunction` class is designed to handle the gradient computation for the Straight-Through Estimator (STE). The STE is used to approximate gradients for non-differentiable functions by treating them as identity functions during the backward pass. Here's a detailed explanation of how the `backward` function is implemented:\n\n### Implementation of the `backward` Function\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Any, Callable, Optional, Tuple\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom torch.autograd import Function\n\nclass STEFunction(Function):\n    @staticmethod\n    def forward(ctx: Any, input: Tensor, output: Tensor, grad_fn: Optional[Callable[..., Any]] = None) -> Tensor:\n        ctx.in_shape = input.shape\n        ctx.out_shape = output.shape\n        ctx.grad_fn = grad_fn\n        return output\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def backward(ctx: Any, grad_output: Tensor) -> Tuple[Tensor, Tensor, None]:\n        # Retrieve the gradient function from the context\n        grad_fn = ctx.grad_fn\n        \n        # If a gradient function is provided, apply it to the grad_output\n        if grad_fn is not None:\n            grad_input = grad_fn(grad_output)\n        else:\n            # If no gradient function is provided, pass the gradient through unchanged\n            grad_input = grad_output\n        \n        # Return the gradient for each input of the forward method\n        # grad_input for `input`, None for `output`, and None for `grad_fn`\n        return grad_input, None, None\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Context (`ctx`)**: \n   - The `ctx` object is used to store information during the forward pass that can be used in the backward pass. In this case, the `grad_fn` is stored in the context to be used later in the backward pass.\n\n2. **Gradient Function (`grad_fn`)**:\n   - The `grad_fn` is an optional function that can be used to modify the gradient. If provided, it is applied to the `grad_output` to transform the gradient. This allows for custom gradient behavior, such as clamping or scaling the gradient.\n\n3. **Return Values**:\n   - The `backward` method returns a tuple with the gradient for each input to the `forward` method. The `forward` method takes three inputs: `input`, `output`, and `grad_fn`.\n   - The gradient for `input` is computed and returned as `grad_input`.\n   - The gradients for `output` and `grad_fn` are `None` because they do not require gradients. The `output` is treated as an identity function, and `grad_fn` is a function, not a tensor, so it does not have a gradient.\n\nThis implementation allows the `STEFunction` to approximate gradients for non-differentiable functions by treating them as identity functions during the backward pass, while also supporting custom gradient transformations through the `grad_fn`.",
    "prompt": "Write the backward function for following class: \nclass STEFunction(Function):\n    \"\"\"Straight-Through Estimation (STE) function.\n\n    STE bridges the gradients between the input tensor and output tensor as if the function\n    was an identity function. Meanwhile, advanced gradient functions are also supported. e.g.\n    the output gradients can be mapped into [-1, 1] with ``F.hardtanh`` function.\n\n    Args:\n        grad_fn: function to restrain the gradient received. If None, no mapping will performed.\n\n    Example:\n        Let the gradients of ``torch.sign`` estimated from STE.\n        >>> input = torch.randn(4, requires_grad = True)\n        >>> output = torch.sign(input)\n        >>> loss = output.mean()\n        >>> loss.backward()\n        >>> input.grad\n        tensor([0., 0., 0., 0.])\n\n        >>> with torch.no_grad():\n        ...     output = torch.sign(input)\n        >>> out_est = STEFunction.apply(input, output)\n        >>> loss = out_est.mean()\n        >>> loss.backward()\n        >>> input.grad\n        tensor([0.2500, 0.2500, 0.2500, 0.2500])\n    \"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def forward(ctx: Any, input: Tensor, output: Tensor, grad_fn: Optional[Callable[..., Any]] = None) -> Tensor:\n        ctx.in_shape = input.shape\n        ctx.out_shape = output.shape\n        ctx.grad_fn = grad_fn\n        return output\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def backward(ctx: Any, grad_output: Tensor) -> Tuple[Tensor, Tensor, None]",
