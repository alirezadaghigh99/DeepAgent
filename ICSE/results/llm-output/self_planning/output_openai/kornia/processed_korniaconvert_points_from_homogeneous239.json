    "result": "The function `convert_points_from_homogeneous` is designed to convert points from homogeneous coordinates to Euclidean coordinates. Let's walk through the implementation step by step, following the plan you provided:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef convert_points_from_homogeneous(points, eps=1e-10):\n    # Step 1: Input Validation\n    if not isinstance(points, torch.Tensor):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a tensor.\")\n    if points.dim() < 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input tensor must have at least two dimensions.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Extract Dimensions\n    B, N, D = points.shape\n    \n    # Step 3: Avoid Division by Zero\n    # Add eps to the last dimension to prevent division by zero\n    last_coord = points[..., -1:] + eps\n    \n    # Step 4: Convert to Euclidean Space\n    euclidean_points = points[..., :-1] / last_coord\n    \n    # Step 5: Return the Result\n    return euclidean_points\n\n# Example usage:\n# points = torch.tensor([[[1.0, 2.0, 1.0], [3.0, 4.0, 1.0]]])\n# result = convert_points_from_homogeneous(points)\n# print(result)  # Should output a tensor of shape (B, N, D-1)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**:\n   - The function first checks if the input `points` is a tensor using `isinstance`. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n   - It then checks if the tensor has at least two dimensions using `points.dim()`. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Extract Dimensions**:\n   - The shape of the tensor is unpacked into `B`, `N`, and `D`, representing the batch size, number of points, and dimensions, respectively.\n\n3. **Avoid Division by Zero**:\n   - To prevent division by zero, `eps` is added to the last coordinate of each point. This ensures numerical stability during division.\n\n4. **Convert to Euclidean Space**:\n   - The Euclidean coordinates are obtained by dividing all but the last coordinate of each point by the last coordinate (adjusted with `eps`). This effectively converts the points from homogeneous to Euclidean space.\n\n5. **Return the Result**:\n   - The function returns the converted tensor, which has a shape of `(B, N, D-1)`.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the conversion is both safe and efficient, handling potential edge cases like division by zero. The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with a sample tensor.",
    "prompt": "Create a function `convert_points_from_homogeneous` that converts points from homogeneous to Euclidean space. The function takes a tensor `points` with shape `(B, N, D)` and an optional `eps` parameter to avoid division by zero. It returns a tensor of shape `(B, N, D-1)` representing the points in Euclidean space. A `TypeError` is raised if the input is not a tensor, and a `ValueError` is raised if the input tensor has fewer than two dimensions.",
