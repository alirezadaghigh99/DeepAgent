    "result": "The function `normal_transform_pixel3d` is designed to compute a normalization matrix that maps pixel coordinates from a 3D image to the range [-1, 1]. This is useful in various computer vision and graphics applications where normalized coordinates are required. Below is the implementation of the function, following the steps outlined in your plan:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef normal_transform_pixel3d(depth, height, width, eps=1e-6, device='cpu', dtype=torch.float32):\n    # Initialize a 4x4 identity matrix\n    transform_matrix = torch.eye(4, dtype=dtype, device=device)\n    \n    # Calculate scaling factors with epsilon to prevent divide-by-zero\n    scale_x = 2.0 / (width + eps)\n    scale_y = 2.0 / (height + eps)\n    scale_z = 2.0 / (depth + eps)\n    \n    # Update the matrix with scaling and translation\n    transform_matrix[0, 0] = scale_x\n    transform_matrix[0, 3] = -1.0\n    transform_matrix[1, 1] = scale_y\n    transform_matrix[1, 3] = -1.0\n    transform_matrix[2, 2] = scale_z\n    transform_matrix[2, 3] = -1.0\n    \n    # Reshape to (1, 4, 4) and return\n    return transform_matrix.unsqueeze(0)\n\n# Example usage\ndepth, height, width = 100, 200, 300\nnormalized_matrix = normal_transform_pixel3d(depth, height, width)\nprint(normalized_matrix)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialize a 4x4 Tensor Matrix**:\n   - We start by creating a 4x4 identity matrix using `torch.eye`, specifying the desired `dtype` and `device`.\n\n2. **Adjust the Matrix for Normalization**:\n   - We calculate the scaling factors for each axis (x, y, z) using the formula `2.0 / (dimension + eps)`. This ensures that the coordinates are scaled to fit within the range [-1, 1].\n   - The translation component is set to `-1.0` for each axis to shift the range from [0, 2] to [-1, 1].\n\n3. **Prevent Divide-by-Zero Errors**:\n   - The `eps` value is added to each dimension to prevent division by zero, which could occur if any dimension is zero.\n\n4. **Construct the Normalized Transform Matrix**:\n   - The identity matrix is updated with the calculated scaling and translation values.\n\n5. **Return the Matrix**:\n   - The matrix is reshaped to have a shape of (1, 4, 4) using `unsqueeze(0)` to match the expected output format.\n\nThis function is flexible and can be used with different devices (e.g., CPU or GPU) and data types, making it suitable for various applications in deep learning and computer graphics.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called normal_transform_pixel3d that computes the normalization matrix from image size in pixels to the range [-1, 1]. The function takes in the image depth, height, width, epsilon value (eps), device, and data type (dtype) as inputs. It returns a normalized transform matrix with a shape of (1, 4, 4). The function first creates a 4x4 tensor matrix and then adjusts the values based on the image dimensions to prevent divide-by-zero errors. Finally, it returns the normalized transform matrix with a shape of 1x4x4.",
