    "result": "To implement the `_jpeg_decode` function, we need to follow the steps outlined in the plan. Here's a detailed implementation using PyTorch and SciPy for the IDCT operation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.fftpack import idct\n\ndef _jpeg_decode(input_y, input_cb, input_cr, jpeg_quality, H, W, quantization_table_y, quantization_table_c):\n    # Step 1: Dequantize the DCT coefficients\n    # Adjust the quantization tables based on the JPEG quality\n    quantization_table_y = quantization_table_y / jpeg_quality[:, None, None, None]\n    quantization_table_c = quantization_table_c / jpeg_quality[:, None, None, None]\n    \n    dequantized_y = input_y * quantization_table_y\n    dequantized_cb = input_cb * quantization_table_c\n    dequantized_cr = input_cr * quantization_table_c\n\n    # Step 2: Apply Inverse DCT (IDCT)\n    def apply_idct(blocks):\n        # Apply IDCT on the last two dimensions (8x8 blocks)\n        blocks = blocks.numpy()  # Convert to numpy for scipy IDCT\n        blocks = idct(idct(blocks, axis=2, norm='ortho'), axis=3, norm='ortho')\n        return torch.tensor(blocks)  # Convert back to torch tensor\n\n    y_idct = apply_idct(dequantized_y)\n    cb_idct = apply_idct(dequantized_cb)\n    cr_idct = apply_idct(dequantized_cr)\n\n    # Step 3: Reconstruct the YCbCr image\n    # Assuming the input is already in the correct shape, no need to reshape\n\n    # Step 4: Upsample the Cb and Cr channels if needed\n    # This step depends on the subsampling method used during encoding\n    # For simplicity, assume no subsampling was used\n\n    # Step 5: Convert YCbCr to RGB\n    def ycbcr_to_rgb(y, cb, cr):\n        # Convert YCbCr to RGB using the standard conversion formula\n        r = y + 1.402 * (cr - 128)\n        g = y - 0.344136 * (cb - 128) - 0.714136 * (cr - 128)\n        b = y + 1.772 * (cb - 128)\n        return torch.stack((r, g, b), dim=1)\n\n    rgb_decoded = ycbcr_to_rgb(y_idct, cb_idct, cr_idct)\n\n    # Step 6: Clip and Normalize Pixel Values\n    rgb_decoded = torch.clamp(rgb_decoded, 0, 255)\n\n    # Step 7: Return the Decoded RGB Image\n    # Reshape the output to match the original image dimensions\n    B, _, _, _ = input_y.shape\n    rgb_decoded = rgb_decoded.view(B, 3, H, W)\n\n    return rgb_decoded\n\n# Note: This function assumes that the input tensors are PyTorch tensors and that the IDCT is applied using scipy's idct function.\n# Adjustments may be needed based on the specific tensor library and IDCT implementation used.\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Dequantization**: The quantization tables are adjusted based on the JPEG quality factor, and then used to dequantize the DCT coefficients.\n- **IDCT**: The inverse DCT is applied using SciPy's `idct` function, which requires conversion between PyTorch tensors and NumPy arrays.\n- **YCbCr to RGB Conversion**: The conversion uses the standard formula for transforming YCbCr to RGB.\n- **Clipping**: The pixel values are clipped to ensure they fall within the valid range of [0, 255].\n- **Reshaping**: The final RGB image is reshaped to match the original image dimensions.\n\nThis implementation assumes no chroma subsampling was used. If subsampling was applied, additional steps would be needed to upsample the Cb and Cr channels.",
