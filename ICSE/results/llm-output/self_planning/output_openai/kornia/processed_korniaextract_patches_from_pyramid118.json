    "result": "To implement the function that extracts image patches from a pyramid of images based on Local Affine Frames (LAFs), we need to follow the outlined plan. Here's a detailed implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef extract_patches_from_pyramid(img, laf, patch_size=32, normalize_lafs=False):\n    B, CH, H, W = img.shape\n    B_laf, N, _, _ = laf.shape\n    assert B == B_laf, \"Batch size of image and LAFs must match.\"\n\n    if normalize_lafs:\n        laf = normalize_lafs_function(laf)\n\n    # Placeholder for extracted patches\n    patches = torch.zeros((B, N, CH, patch_size, patch_size), dtype=img.dtype, device=img.device)\n\n    for b in range(B):\n        for n in range(N):\n            # Extract the affine transformation matrix for the current LAF\n            affine_matrix = laf[b, n]\n\n            # Determine the appropriate pyramid level based on the scale\n            scale = torch.sqrt(torch.det(affine_matrix[:, :2]))\n            pyramid_level = determine_pyramid_level(scale)\n\n            # Adjust the image size according to the pyramid level\n            scaled_img = F.interpolate(img[b:b+1], scale_factor=1/(2**pyramid_level), mode='bilinear', align_corners=False)\n\n            # Extract the patch using grid_sample\n            grid = F.affine_grid(affine_matrix.unsqueeze(0), (1, CH, patch_size, patch_size), align_corners=False)\n            patch = F.grid_sample(scaled_img, grid, mode='bilinear', padding_mode='border', align_corners=False)\n\n            # Store the extracted patch\n            patches[b, n] = patch.squeeze(0)\n\n    return patches\n\ndef normalize_lafs_function(laf):\n    # Implement normalization logic if needed\n    # For example, normalize the translation part to be within the image bounds\n    return laf\n\ndef determine_pyramid_level(scale):\n    # Implement logic to determine the pyramid level based on scale\n    # For simplicity, let's assume a basic rule where scale determines the level\n    if scale < 0.5:\n        return 1\n    elif scale < 0.25:\n        return 2\n    else:\n        return 0\n\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Normalization**: The `normalize_lafs_function` is a placeholder for any normalization logic you might need. This could involve ensuring that the LAFs are within the image bounds or have a certain scale.\n\n2. **Pyramid Level Determination**: The `determine_pyramid_level` function decides which pyramid level to use based on the scale of the LAF. This is a simple heuristic and can be adjusted based on your specific needs.\n\n3. **Patch Extraction**: \n   - The `affine_grid` function creates a grid for sampling the image based on the affine transformation matrix.\n   - The `grid_sample` function extracts the patch from the image using the grid. The `padding_mode='border'` ensures that if the LAF is near the boundary, the border values are used to fill the patch.\n\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function handles cases where the LAF might be near the image boundary by using `padding_mode='border'`.\n\nThis implementation provides a basic structure for extracting patches from a pyramid of images based on LAFs, with placeholders for specific logic that may vary depending on the application. Adjust the `determine_pyramid_level` function to better fit your pyramid scaling strategy.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function that extracts image patches from a pyramid of images based on input Local Affine Frames (LAFs). The function should take as input an image tensor `img` of shape `(B, CH, H, W)` and LAFs `laf` of shape `(B, N, 2, 3)`. Optionally, normalize the LAFs before extraction. The function should return a tensor of extracted patches of shape `(B, N, CH, PS, PS)`. The extraction should be done at the appropriate pyramid level based on the scale of each LAF. Ensure that the function handles various cases, such as when no patches need to be extracted at a particular pyramid level.",
