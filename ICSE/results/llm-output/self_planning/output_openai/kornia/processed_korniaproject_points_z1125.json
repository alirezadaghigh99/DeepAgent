    "result": "The function `project_points_z1` is designed to project points from the camera frame onto the canonical z=1 plane using perspective division. Let's walk through the implementation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: We first check if the input tensor `points_in_camera` has the correct shape, ensuring that each point has three components (x, y, z).\n\n2. **Perspective Division**: We perform perspective division by dividing the x and y coordinates by the z coordinate for each point. This projects the points onto the z=1 plane.\n\n3. **Output Construction**: We construct the output tensor with the shape (..., 2), which contains the projected x and y coordinates.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the tensor containing the projected points.\n\nHere's the complete implementation in Python using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef project_points_z1(points_in_camera):\n    # Ensure the input tensor has the correct shape (..., 3)\n    if points_in_camera.shape[-1] != 3:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input tensor must have shape (..., 3)\")\n\n    # Extract x, y, z components\n    x = points_in_camera[..., 0]\n    y = points_in_camera[..., 1]\n    z = points_in_camera[..., 2]\n\n    # Perform perspective division\n    projected_x = x / z\n    projected_y = y / z\n\n    # Construct the output tensor with shape (..., 2)\n    projected_points = torch.stack((projected_x, projected_y), dim=-1)\n\n    return projected_points\n\n# Example usage\npoints = torch.tensor([1., 2., 3.])\nprint(project_points_z1(points))  # Output: tensor([0.3333, 0.6667])\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Input Shape**: The function checks that the last dimension of the input tensor is 3, which corresponds to the x, y, and z coordinates.\n- **Perspective Division**: This is the core operation where each x and y coordinate is divided by the z coordinate to project the point onto the z=1 plane.\n- **Handling z <= 0**: The function assumes that z > 0 for all points. If z <= 0, the division will still occur, but it may lead to undefined behavior or numerical issues, especially if z is zero.\n\nThis function is useful in computer vision and graphics applications where projecting 3D points onto a 2D plane is a common operation.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called project_points_z1 that projects one or more points from the camera frame into the canonical z=1 plane through perspective division. The input is a tensor called points_in_camera with shape (..., 3) representing the points to project. The function has a precondition that the points are in front of the camera (z > 0). If this is not the case, the points will be projected to the canonical plane, but the resulting points will be behind the camera and may cause numerical issues for z == 0. The output is a tensor representing the projected points with shape (..., 2). An example usage of the function is as follows:\n\n```python\npoints = torch.tensor([1., 2., 3.])\nproject_points_z1(points)\n```\n\nThis will return a tensor with values [0.3333, 0.6667].",
