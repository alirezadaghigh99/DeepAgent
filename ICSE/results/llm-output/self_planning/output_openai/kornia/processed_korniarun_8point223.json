    "result": "The provided Python function `run_8point` is designed to compute the fundamental matrix using the Direct Linear Transform (DLT) formulation with a Weighted Least Squares Solution. Let's go through the implementation step-by-step to ensure it aligns with the outlined procedure:\n\n1. **Normalize Points**: The function `normalize_points` calculates the centroid of the points, centers them, and scales them so that their average distance from the origin is \u221a2. It also constructs a transformation matrix `T` for each batch.\n\n2. **Construct the Linear System**: The function `construct_matrix` constructs the matrix `A` for the linear system `Ax = 0` using the normalized point correspondences.\n\n3. **Apply Weights**: The weights are applied by scaling each row of the matrix `A` with the corresponding weight.\n\n4. **Solve the Linear System**: The function uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to solve the linear system. The smallest singular value's corresponding right singular vector gives the solution.\n\n5. **Enforce Rank-2 Constraint**: The function `enforce_rank2` ensures the fundamental matrix is of rank 2 by setting the smallest singular value to zero and recomputing the matrix using SVD.\n\n6. **Denormalize the Fundamental Matrix**: The fundamental matrix is transformed back to the original coordinate system using the inverse of the normalization transformations.\n\n7. **Return the Fundamental Matrix**: The function returns the computed fundamental matrix for each batch.\n\nHere's the complete function with comments for clarity:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef run_8point(points1, points2, weights):\n    def normalize_points(points):\n        # Compute the centroid of the points\n        centroid = points.mean(dim=1, keepdim=True)\n        # Center the points around the origin\n        centered_points = points - centroid\n        # Scale the points so that the average distance from the origin is \u221a2\n        scale = torch.sqrt(2.0) / torch.mean(torch.norm(centered_points, dim=2), dim=1, keepdim=True)\n        normalized_points = centered_points * scale.unsqueeze(-1)\n        # Construct the normalization transformation matrix\n        T = torch.zeros((points.shape[0], 3, 3), device=points.device)\n        T[:, 0, 0] = scale.squeeze()\n        T[:, 1, 1] = scale.squeeze()\n        T[:, 2, 2] = 1\n        T[:, 0, 2] = -centroid[:, 0] * scale.squeeze()\n        T[:, 1, 2] = -centroid[:, 1] * scale.squeeze()\n        return normalized_points, T\n\n    def construct_matrix(points1, points2):\n        # Extract coordinates\n        x1, y1 = points1[:, :, 0], points1[:, :, 1]\n        x2, y2 = points2[:, :, 0], points2[:, :, 1]\n        # Construct the matrix A for the linear system\n        A = torch.stack([x2 * x1, x2 * y1, x2, y2 * x1, y2 * y1, y2, x1, y1, torch.ones_like(x1)], dim=2)\n        return A\n\n    def enforce_rank2(F):\n        # Perform SVD on the fundamental matrix\n        U, S, Vt = torch.svd(F)\n        # Set the smallest singular value to zero\n        S[:, -1] = 0\n        # Recompute the fundamental matrix with rank-2 constraint\n        return U @ torch.diag_embed(S) @ Vt.transpose(-2, -1)\n\n    # Normalize points\n    points1_normalized, T1 = normalize_points(points1)\n    points2_normalized, T2 = normalize_points(points2)\n\n    # Construct the linear system\n    A = construct_matrix(points1_normalized, points2_normalized)\n    # Apply weights to the linear system\n    A *= weights.unsqueeze(-1)\n\n    # Solve the linear system using SVD\n    _, _, Vt = torch.svd(A)\n    # Extract the solution corresponding to the smallest singular value\n    F_normalized = Vt[:, -1].view(-1, 3, 3)\n\n    # Enforce rank-2 constraint\n    F_normalized = enforce_rank2(F_normalized)\n\n    # Denormalize the fundamental matrix\n    F = T2.transpose(-2, -1) @ F_normalized @ T1\n\n    return F\n\n# Example usage:\n# points1 = torch.rand((B, N, 2))\n# points2 = torch.rand((B, N, 2))\n# weights = torch.rand((B, N))\n# F = run_8point(points1, points2, weights)\n```\n\nThis function is designed to handle batches of point correspondences and weights, making it suitable for processing multiple sets of points simultaneously.",
