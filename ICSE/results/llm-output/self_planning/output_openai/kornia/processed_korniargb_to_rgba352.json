    "result": "Let's focus on implementing the `rgb_to_rgba` function as described in your plan. This function will convert an RGB image to an RGBA image by adding an alpha channel. Here's how you can implement it in Python using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef rgb_to_rgba(image, alpha_val):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert an RGB image to RGBA by adding an alpha channel.\n\n    Args:\n        image (torch.Tensor): RGB Image to be converted to RGBA of shape (*, 3, H, W).\n        alpha_val (float or torch.Tensor): A float number for the alpha value or a tensor\n                                           of shape (*, 1, H, W).\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: RGBA version of the image with shape (*, 4, H, W).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the input image has the correct shape\n    if image.shape[-3] != 3:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input image must have 3 channels in the last but third dimension.\")\n\n    # Determine the shape of the alpha channel\n    alpha_shape = list(image.shape)\n    alpha_shape[-3] = 1  # Change the channel dimension to 1\n\n    # Create the alpha channel\n    if isinstance(alpha_val, float):\n        alpha_channel = torch.full(alpha_shape, alpha_val, dtype=image.dtype, device=image.device)\n    elif isinstance(alpha_val, torch.Tensor):\n        if alpha_val.shape != tuple(alpha_shape):\n            raise ValueError(\"Alpha tensor must have shape (*, 1, H, W).\")\n        alpha_channel = alpha_val\n    else:\n        raise TypeError(\"alpha_val must be either a float or a torch.Tensor.\")\n\n    # Concatenate the RGB image with the alpha channel\n    rgba_image = torch.cat((image, alpha_channel), dim=-3)\n\n    return rgba_image\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_image = torch.rand(2, 3, 4, 5)  # Example RGB image\n    alpha_value = 1.0  # Example alpha value\n    output_image = rgb_to_rgba(input_image, alpha_value)\n    print(output_image.shape)  # Should print torch.Size([2, 4, 4, 5])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Check Input Shape**: The function first checks if the input image has 3 channels in the last but third dimension, which is required for an RGB image.\n\n2. **Add Alpha Channel**:\n   - If `alpha_val` is a float, a tensor filled with this value is created with the same batch size and spatial dimensions as the input image.\n   - If `alpha_val` is a tensor, it checks if the shape matches the expected shape for the alpha channel.\n\n3. **Concatenate Channels**: The RGB image is concatenated with the alpha channel along the channel dimension to form an RGBA image.\n\n4. **Return RGBA Image**: The function returns the resulting RGBA image.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input image is a PyTorch tensor and handles both float and tensor types for the alpha value.",
