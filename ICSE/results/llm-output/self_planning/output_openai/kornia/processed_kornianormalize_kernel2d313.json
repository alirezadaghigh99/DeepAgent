    "result": "Here's the complete implementation of the `normalize_kernel2d` function, which normalizes a 2D kernel by ensuring that the sum of its elements equals 1. This is a common requirement in image processing to maintain the overall intensity of the image after applying the kernel.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\n\ndef normalize_kernel2d(input: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n    r\"\"\"Normalize both derivative and smoothing kernel.\"\"\"\n    # Ensure the input is a 2D kernel\n    if input.dim() != 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a 2D tensor\")\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the kernel elements\n    kernel_sum = input.sum()\n\n    # Check if the sum is zero to avoid division by zero\n    if kernel_sum == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"The sum of the kernel elements is zero, cannot normalize\")\n\n    # Normalize the kernel\n    normalized_kernel = input / kernel_sum\n\n    return normalized_kernel\n\n# Example usage\nkernel = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])\nnormalized_kernel = normalize_kernel2d(kernel)\nprint(normalized_kernel)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Check**: The function first checks if the input tensor is 2-dimensional. If not, it raises a `ValueError`. This ensures that the function is only used with 2D kernels.\n\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of all elements in the kernel is calculated using `input.sum()`. This sum is used to normalize the kernel.\n\n3. **Zero Sum Check**: Before normalizing, the function checks if the sum is zero. If the sum is zero, normalization would result in division by zero, which is undefined. In such cases, a `ValueError` is raised.\n\n4. **Normalization**: Each element of the kernel is divided by the total sum, effectively normalizing the kernel so that the sum of its elements equals 1.\n\n5. **Return**: The function returns the normalized kernel, which can then be used in image processing tasks.\n\nThis function is useful in scenarios where you need to apply a kernel to an image and want to ensure that the overall intensity of the image is preserved.",
