    "result": "Let's focus on implementing the `aepe` function, which calculates the average endpoint error (AEPE) between two flow maps. Here's how you can implement this function in Python using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef aepe(input, target, reduction='mean'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Average Endpoint Error (AEPE) between two flow maps.\n\n    Args:\n        input (torch.Tensor): The input flow map with shape (*, 2).\n        target (torch.Tensor): The target flow map with shape (*, 2).\n        reduction (str): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output: \n                         'none' | 'mean' | 'sum'. 'none': no reduction will be applied,\n                         'mean': the sum of the output will be divided by the number of elements\n                         in the output, 'sum': the output will be summed.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: The computed AEPE as a scalar or tensor depending on the reduction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure the input and target have the same shape\n    if input.shape != target.shape:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input and target must have the same shape\")\n\n    # Calculate the squared differences\n    diff = input - target\n    squared_diff = diff ** 2\n\n    # Sum the squared differences along the last dimension (2D vectors)\n    sum_squared_diff = squared_diff.sum(dim=-1)\n\n    # Calculate the square root to get the endpoint error\n    endpoint_error = torch.sqrt(sum_squared_diff)\n\n    # Apply the specified reduction\n    if reduction == 'mean':\n        return endpoint_error.mean()\n    elif reduction == 'sum':\n        return endpoint_error.sum()\n    elif reduction == 'none':\n        return endpoint_error\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Invalid reduction type: {reduction}. Choose from 'none', 'mean', 'sum'.\")\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    ones = torch.ones(4, 4, 2)\n    result = aepe(ones, 1.2 * ones)\n    print(result)  # Should print a tensor with the AEPE value\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the input and target tensors have the same shape. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Difference Calculation**: It computes the difference between the input and target flow maps.\n\n3. **Squared Differences**: The squared differences are calculated for each component of the 2D vectors.\n\n4. **Sum and Square Root**: The squared differences are summed along the last dimension, and the square root is taken to compute the endpoint error for each vector.\n\n5. **Reduction**: Depending on the `reduction` parameter, the function either returns the mean, sum, or no reduction of the endpoint errors.\n\nThis function is designed to be flexible and can handle different reduction methods as specified by the user.",
