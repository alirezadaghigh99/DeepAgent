    "result": "Let's focus on implementing the `_cdist` function as described. This function will compute the pairwise Euclidean distance between two tensors, `d1` and `d2`. If the tensors are not safe for Metal Performance Shaders (MPS), it will use `torch.cdist`. Otherwise, it will manually compute the distances using matrix operations.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `_cdist` function in Python:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _cdist(d1, d2):\n    # Check if tensors are MPS safe\n    def is_mps_safe(tensor):\n        # Assuming MPS safety is determined by the device type and dtype\n        return tensor.device.type == 'mps' and tensor.dtype in [torch.float32, torch.float16]\n\n    # If not MPS safe, use torch.cdist directly\n    if not (is_mps_safe(d1) and is_mps_safe(d2)):\n        return torch.cdist(d1, d2)\n\n    # Manually compute the Euclidean distances\n    # Compute squared distances\n    d1_squared = torch.sum(d1 ** 2, dim=1, keepdim=True)\n    d2_squared = torch.sum(d2 ** 2, dim=1, keepdim=True)\n\n    # Compute the cross term\n    cross_term = torch.mm(d1, d2.t())\n\n    # Compute the distance matrix\n    dist_matrix = d1_squared - 2 * cross_term + d2_squared.t()\n\n    # Clamp to ensure no negative distances due to floating point errors\n    dist_matrix = torch.clamp(dist_matrix, min=0.0)\n\n    # Take the square root to get the Euclidean distance\n    dist_matrix = torch.sqrt(dist_matrix)\n\n    return dist_matrix\n\n# Example usage:\n# d1 = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], device='mps')\n# d2 = torch.tensor([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]], device='mps')\n# distances = _cdist(d1, d2)\n# print(distances)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **MPS Safety Check**: The function `is_mps_safe` checks if a tensor is on the MPS device and has a compatible data type (e.g., `float32` or `float16`).\n\n2. **Direct Use of `torch.cdist`**: If either tensor is not MPS safe, the function uses `torch.cdist` to compute the distances directly.\n\n3. **Manual Computation**:\n   - **Squared Distances**: Compute the squared norm of each row in `d1` and `d2`.\n   - **Cross Term**: Compute the matrix multiplication of `d1` and the transpose of `d2`.\n   - **Distance Matrix**: Use the formula for Euclidean distance: \\((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\\).\n   - **Clamping**: Ensure no negative values due to floating-point precision issues.\n   - **Square Root**: Take the square root to get the final Euclidean distances.\n\nThis function should work efficiently for tensors that are MPS safe and fall back to `torch.cdist` when they are not.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `_cdist` that:\n\n- Takes two parameters:\n  - `d1`: A tensor.\n  - `d2`: Another tensor.\n- The function calculates the pairwise Euclidean distance between `d1` and `d2` similar to `torch.cdist`.\n- If both tensors are not safe for Metal Performance Shaders (MPS), the function will use `torch.cdist` directly.\n- Otherwise, the function manually computes the Euclidean distances using matrix operations:\n  - Computes the squared distance for each tensor.\n  - Repeats the squared distances and performs matrix multiplication.\n  - Clamps the result to a minimum of 0.0 and takes the square root to get the final distances.\n- Returns the computed distance matrix.",
