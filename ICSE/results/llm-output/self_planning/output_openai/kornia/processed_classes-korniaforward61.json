    "result": "Here's the implementation of the `forward` method for the `DiceLoss` class, following the steps outlined in your plan. This method calculates the S\u00f8rensen-Dice Coefficient loss for multi-class segmentation tasks, supporting both 'micro' and 'macro' reduction methods, and includes options for numerical stability and class weighting.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass DiceLoss(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, average: str = \"micro\", eps: float = 1e-8, weight: Optional[Tensor] = None) -> None:\n        super(DiceLoss, self).__init__()\n        self.average = average\n        self.eps = eps\n        self.weight = weight\n\n    def forward(self, pred: Tensor, target: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # Validate inputs\n        if pred.shape != target.shape:\n            raise ValueError(\"Shape of pred and target must match.\")\n        if self.average not in [\"micro\", \"macro\"]:\n            raise ValueError(\"Average must be either 'micro' or 'macro'.\")\n\n        # Convert target to one-hot if necessary\n        if target.ndim == pred.ndim - 1:\n            target = torch.nn.functional.one_hot(target, num_classes=pred.shape[1]).permute(0, 3, 1, 2)\n\n        # Compute intersection and union\n        intersection = (pred * target).sum(dim=(2, 3))\n        union = pred.sum(dim=(2, 3)) + target.sum(dim=(2, 3))\n\n        # Calculate Dice coefficient\n        if self.average == \"micro\":\n            dice_score = (2 * intersection.sum(dim=1) + self.eps) / (union.sum(dim=1) + self.eps)\n        elif self.average == \"macro\":\n            dice_score = (2 * intersection + self.eps) / (union + self.eps)\n            if self.weight is not None:\n                dice_score = dice_score * self.weight\n            dice_score = dice_score.mean(dim=1)\n\n        # Compute Dice loss\n        dice_loss = 1 - dice_score.mean()\n\n        return dice_loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The method checks if the shapes of `pred` and `target` match and if the `average` parameter is valid.\n\n2. **One-Hot Encoding**: If `target` is not already one-hot encoded, it is converted to a one-hot format to match the number of classes in `pred`.\n\n3. **Intersection and Union Calculation**: The intersection and union are computed for each class. The intersection is the element-wise multiplication of `pred` and `target`, and the union is the sum of `pred` and `target`.\n\n4. **Dice Coefficient Calculation**:\n   - **Micro**: The intersection and union are summed across all classes before computing the Dice coefficient.\n   - **Macro**: The Dice coefficient is computed for each class separately, and then averaged. If class weights are provided, they are applied to the Dice coefficients.\n\n5. **Dice Loss Calculation**: The Dice loss is `1 - Dice coefficient`, ensuring numerical stability by adding `eps` to the denominator.\n\nThis implementation is designed to handle multi-class segmentation tasks efficiently, with flexibility for different averaging methods and class weighting.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `forward` for the `DiceLoss` class that computes the S\u00f8rensen-Dice Coefficient loss for multi-class segmentation tasks. The method should take as input the predicted scores `pred` and the ground truth labels `target`, and return the computed Dice loss. The method should support two reduction methods: `'micro'` (calculates the loss across all classes) and `'macro'` (calculates the loss for each class separately and averages the loss across classes). The loss should also include options for numerical stability with `eps` and class weighting with `weight`.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass DiceLoss(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, average: str = \"micro\", eps: float = 1e-8, weight: Optional[Tensor] = None) -> None:\n        self.average = average\n        self.eps = eps\n        self.weight = weight\n\n    def forward(self, pred: Tensor, target: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
