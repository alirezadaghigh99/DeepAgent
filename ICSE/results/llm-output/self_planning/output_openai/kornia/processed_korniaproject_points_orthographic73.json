    "result": "The function `project_points_orthographic` is designed to project 3D points from the camera frame onto a 2D plane using orthographic projection. Let's break down the implementation and ensure it meets the requirements:\n\n### Implementation Steps:\n\n1. **Input Validation**:\n   - The function checks if the input tensor has a last dimension of size 3, which is necessary to represent 3D points \\([x, y, z]\\).\n\n2. **Orthographic Projection**:\n   - The orthographic projection is achieved by simply selecting the first two coordinates (x and y) from each 3D point, effectively ignoring the z-coordinate. This is done using tensor slicing.\n\n3. **Return the Result**:\n   - The function returns a tensor containing the 2D projected points.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef project_points_orthographic(points_in_camera):\n    \"\"\"\n    Project one or more points from the camera frame into the canonical z=1 plane through orthographic projection.\n\n    Args:\n        points_in_camera: Tensor of shape (..., 3) representing the points to project.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor of shape (..., 2) representing the projected points.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure the input is a tensor with the last dimension of size 3\n    if points_in_camera.shape[-1] != 3:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input tensor must have a last dimension of size 3 representing 3D points.\")\n\n    # Perform orthographic projection by selecting the first two coordinates\n    projected_points = points_in_camera[..., :2]\n\n    return projected_points\n\n# Example usage\npoints = torch.tensor([1., 2., 3.])\nprint(project_points_orthographic(points))  # Output: tensor([1., 2.])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Input Validation**: The function checks if the input tensor's last dimension is 3, ensuring it represents 3D points. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n- **Projection**: The slicing operation `points_in_camera[..., :2]` selects the x and y coordinates from each 3D point, effectively performing the orthographic projection.\n\n- **Return**: The function returns a tensor of the projected 2D points.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\nThe example provided demonstrates how to use the function with a single 3D point. The function can also handle batches of points due to its use of tensor operations, making it efficient for processing multiple points simultaneously.\n\nThis implementation is efficient and leverages PyTorch's capabilities to handle potentially large datasets of 3D points, projecting them onto a 2D plane using orthographic projection.",
