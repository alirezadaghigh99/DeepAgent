    "result": "To implement the `rt_matrix` function within the `PinholeCamera` class, we need to ensure that the function correctly extracts and concatenates the rotation and translation components from the extrinsics tensor. Here's the complete implementation based on your description:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\n\nclass PinholeCamera:\n    def __init__(self, intrinsics: Tensor, extrinsics: Tensor, height: Tensor, width: Tensor) -> None:\n        self.height: Tensor = height\n        self.width: Tensor = width\n        self._intrinsics: Tensor = intrinsics\n        self._extrinsics: Tensor = extrinsics\n\n    def rt_matrix(self) -> Tensor:\n        # Assuming extrinsics is a batch of 4x4 matrices with shape (B, 4, 4)\n        # Extract the rotation matrix (3x3) and translation vector (3x1)\n        rotation_matrix = self._extrinsics[:, :3, :3]  # Extract the 3x3 rotation part\n        translation_vector = self._extrinsics[:, :3, 3].unsqueeze(-1)  # Extract the 3x1 translation part\n\n        # Concatenate rotation and translation to form a 3x4 matrix\n        rt_matrix = torch.cat((rotation_matrix, translation_vector), dim=-1)\n\n        return rt_matrix\n\n# Example usage:\n# Assuming you have tensors for intrinsics, extrinsics, height, and width\n# intrinsics = torch.rand((B, 3, 3))\n# extrinsics = torch.rand((B, 4, 4))\n# height = torch.tensor([480])\n# width = torch.tensor([640])\n\n# camera = PinholeCamera(intrinsics, extrinsics, height, width)\n# rt_matrix = camera.rt_matrix()\n# print(rt_matrix.shape)  # Should print (B, 3, 4)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Batch Processing**: The implementation assumes that the extrinsics tensor is a batch of 4x4 matrices, where `B` is the batch size. This is common in applications where multiple cameras or multiple frames are processed simultaneously.\n- **Rotation and Translation Extraction**: The rotation matrix is extracted from the top-left 3x3 part of the extrinsics matrix, and the translation vector is extracted from the top-right 3x1 part.\n- **Concatenation**: The rotation matrix and translation vector are concatenated along the last dimension to form a 3x4 matrix for each item in the batch.\n- **Return**: The function returns a tensor of shape `(B, 3, 4)`, where `B` is the batch size.\n\nThis implementation should work for typical use cases in computer vision where camera extrinsics are represented as 4x4 transformation matrices. Adjustments may be necessary if the format of the extrinsics tensor differs in your specific application.",
