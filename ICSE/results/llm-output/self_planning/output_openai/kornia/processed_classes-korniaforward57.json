    "result": "To implement the `forward` method for the `AdjustHue` class, we need to adjust the hue of an RGB image tensor. The process involves converting the image from the RGB color space to the HSV color space, adjusting the hue, and then converting it back to RGB. Here's a detailed breakdown of the implementation:\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Convert RGB to HSV:**\n   - Use a function to convert the RGB image to HSV. This allows us to manipulate the hue directly.\n\n2. **Adjust the Hue:**\n   - Modify the hue channel by adding the `hue_factor`. Ensure that the hue values wrap around correctly, i.e., they should remain within the valid range [0, 1].\n\n3. **Convert HSV back to RGB:**\n   - After adjusting the hue, convert the image back to the RGB color space.\n\n4. **Return the Adjusted Image:**\n   - Ensure the output tensor maintains the same shape and value range as the input.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `forward` method:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom torchvision.transforms.functional import rgb_to_hsv, hsv_to_rgb\nfrom torch.nn import Module\n\nclass AdjustHue(Module):\n    def forward(self, input: Tensor, hue_factor: float) -> Tensor:\n        # Convert the input RGB image to HSV\n        hsv_image = rgb_to_hsv(input)\n        \n        # Extract the hue, saturation, and value channels\n        h, s, v = hsv_image.unbind(dim=-3)\n        \n        # Adjust the hue channel by the hue_factor\n        h = (h + hue_factor) % 1.0  # Ensure the hue wraps around\n        \n        # Recombine the adjusted hue with the original saturation and value\n        adjusted_hsv = torch.stack((h, s, v), dim=-3)\n        \n        # Convert the adjusted HSV image back to RGB\n        adjusted_rgb = hsv_to_rgb(adjusted_hsv)\n        \n        return adjusted_rgb\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **RGB to HSV Conversion:** The `rgb_to_hsv` function is used to convert the input RGB image to HSV. This function is part of the `torchvision.transforms.functional` module.\n\n- **Hue Adjustment:** The hue channel is adjusted by adding the `hue_factor`. The modulo operation ensures that the hue value wraps around within the range [0, 1]. This is crucial because hue is a circular value.\n\n- **HSV to RGB Conversion:** After adjusting the hue, the `hsv_to_rgb` function is used to convert the image back to RGB.\n\n- **Output:** The adjusted RGB image is returned, maintaining the same shape and value range as the input.\n\nThis implementation assumes the availability of `rgb_to_hsv` and `hsv_to_rgb` functions from the `torchvision.transforms.functional` module, which are commonly used for such color space conversions. If these functions are not available, you would need to implement the RGB to HSV conversion and vice versa manually.",
    "prompt": "**Task:** Write the `forward` method for the `AdjustHue` class. This method should adjust the hue of the input image tensor by a specified hue factor.\n**Class Context:**\n```python\nclass AdjustHue(Module):\n    def forward(self, input: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # Implement this function\n```\n- The method should apply the hue adjustment to the input tensor using the provided `hue_factor`.\n- The input tensor is expected to be an RGB image with pixel values in the range [0, 1] and of shape `(*, 3, H, W)`\nThis prompt instructs the user to implement the `forward` method for adjusting the hue of an image tensor using the provided `hue_factor`.",
