    "result": "To implement the `depth_from_point` function, we need to follow the steps outlined in your request. Let's break down the implementation:\n\n1. **Understand the Inputs and Outputs**:\n   - Inputs:\n     - `R`: A rotation matrix of shape `(*, 3, 3)`.\n     - `t`: A translation vector of shape `(*, 3, 1)`.\n     - `X`: A set of 3D points of shape `(*, 3)`.\n   - Output:\n     - The depth value for each point, with shape `(*, 1)`.\n\n2. **Transform the Points**:\n   - Apply the rigid transformation to the 3D points. This involves rotating the points using the rotation matrix `R` and then translating them using the translation vector `t`.\n\n3. **Compute the Depth**:\n   - The depth of a point in a transformed space is typically the z-coordinate of the transformed point. After applying the transformation, extract the z-coordinate to get the depth.\n\n4. **Return the Depth Values**:\n   - Ensure the output is in the correct shape `(*, 1)`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `depth_from_point` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef depth_from_point(R, t, X):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return the depth of a point transformed by a rigid transform.\n\n    Args:\n       R: The rotation matrix with shape :math:`(*, 3, 3)`.\n       t: The translation vector with shape :math:`(*, 3, 1)`.\n       X: The 3d points with shape :math:`(*, 3)`.\n\n    Returns:\n       The depth value per point with shape :math:`(*, 1)`.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure inputs are numpy arrays\n    R = np.asarray(R)\n    t = np.asarray(t)\n    X = np.asarray(X)\n\n    # Apply the rigid transformation: X' = R * X + t\n    # Reshape X to ensure matrix multiplication compatibility\n    X_transformed = np.matmul(R, X[..., np.newaxis]) + t\n\n    # Extract the z-coordinate (depth) from the transformed points\n    depth = X_transformed[..., 2, 0]  # Get the z-coordinate\n\n    # Reshape to ensure the output shape is (*, 1)\n    depth = depth.reshape(-1, 1)\n\n    return depth\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Matrix Multiplication**: We use `np.matmul` to perform the matrix multiplication between the rotation matrix `R` and the points `X`. The points are reshaped to ensure compatibility for matrix multiplication.\n- **Translation**: The translation vector `t` is added to the rotated points.\n- **Depth Extraction**: The z-coordinate (third component) of the transformed points is extracted to represent the depth.\n- **Output Shape**: The depth values are reshaped to ensure they have the shape `(*, 1)`.\n\nThis function will correctly compute the depth of each point after applying the rigid transformation defined by the rotation matrix `R` and the translation vector `t`.",
