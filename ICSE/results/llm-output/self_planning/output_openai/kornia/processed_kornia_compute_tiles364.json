    "result": "Here's a detailed implementation of the `_compute_tiles` function based on the steps you've outlined. This function will take a batch of 2D images, a grid size, and an optional flag to ensure even tile sizes, and it will return the computed tiles and the padded images.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef _compute_tiles(images, grid_size, even_tile_size=False):\n    # Parse inputs\n    B, C, H, W = images.shape\n    GH, GW = grid_size\n\n    # Calculate initial tile dimensions\n    TH = H // GH\n    TW = W // GW\n\n    # Ensure even tile size if required\n    if even_tile_size:\n        if TH % 2 != 0:\n            TH += 1\n        if TW % 2 != 0:\n            TW += 1\n\n    # Calculate necessary padding\n    pad_h = (GH * TH - H) if GH * TH > H else 0\n    pad_w = (GW * TW - W) if GW * TW > W else 0\n\n    # Pad images\n    # Padding is applied as (left, right, top, bottom)\n    padded_images = F.pad(images, (0, pad_w, 0, pad_h))\n\n    # Validate grid size\n    padded_H, padded_W = padded_images.shape[2], padded_images.shape[3]\n    if GH * TH > padded_H or GW * TW > padded_W:\n        raise ValueError(\"Grid size exceeds image dimensions after padding.\")\n\n    # Compute tiles\n    # Unfold the padded images to extract tiles\n    tiles = padded_images.unfold(2, TH, TH).unfold(3, TW, TW)\n    # Permute to get the desired shape (B, GH, GW, C, TH, TW)\n    tiles = tiles.permute(0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5)\n\n    return tiles, padded_images\n\n# Example usage:\n# images = torch.randn(2, 3, 100, 100)  # Batch of 2 images, 3 channels, 100x100 pixels\n# grid_size = (5, 5)  # 5x5 grid\n# tiles, padded_images = _compute_tiles(images, grid_size, even_tile_size=True)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Parsing and Validation**:\n   - The function accepts a batch of images with shape `(B, C, H, W)` and a grid size `(GH, GW)`.\n   - It calculates the initial tile dimensions `TH` and `TW` by dividing the image dimensions by the grid size.\n\n2. **Even Tile Size Adjustment**:\n   - If `even_tile_size` is `True`, the function adjusts `TH` and `TW` to be even numbers.\n\n3. **Padding Calculation and Application**:\n   - The function calculates the necessary padding to ensure the grid size fits the image dimensions.\n   - It uses `torch.nn.functional.pad` to pad the images, ensuring the padding is evenly distributed.\n\n4. **Grid Size Validation**:\n   - After padding, the function checks if the grid size can fit the padded image dimensions. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n5. **Tile Computation**:\n   - The function uses `unfold` to extract tiles from the padded images and permutes the dimensions to get the desired shape `(B, GH, GW, C, TH, TW)`.\n\n6. **Return**:\n   - The function returns a tuple containing the tensor of computed tiles and the padded batch of images.\n\nThis implementation should handle the task of computing tiles from a batch of images, ensuring that the tiles are of even size if specified, and that the images are padded appropriately.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function _compute_tiles that takes a batch of 2D images as a PyTorch tensor, a grid size tuple representing the number of tiles to crop in each direction, and an optional boolean even_tile_size to ensure the tiles have even dimensions. The function should return a tuple containing two tensors: one with the computed tiles and another with the padded batch of images. The tile tensor should have the shape (B, GH, GW, C, TH, TW), where B is the batch size. Ensure that the image is padded appropriately if the grid size does not perfectly fit the image dimensions. Raise a ValueError if the grid size exceeds the image dimensions after padding.",
