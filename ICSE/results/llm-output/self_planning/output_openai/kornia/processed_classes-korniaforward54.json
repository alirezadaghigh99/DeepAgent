    "result": "To implement the `forward` method for the `Rot180` class, we need to rotate the input tensor by 180 degrees. This can be achieved by flipping the tensor both vertically and horizontally. Let's go through the steps to implement this:\n\n### Steps to Implement the `forward` Method:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Shape**: The input tensor can be a single image with shape `(C, H, W)` or a batch of images with shape `(*, C, H, W)`, where `*` represents any number of leading dimensions (e.g., batch size).\n\n2. **Rotate by 180 Degrees**: Rotating by 180 degrees is equivalent to flipping the tensor upside down and then left to right. This can be done using tensor operations.\n\n3. **Implement the Flipping**:\n   - For a single image `(C, H, W)`, use slicing to reverse the order of elements along the height and width dimensions.\n   - For a batch of images `(*, C, H, W)`, the same slicing technique can be applied, and it will work across all images in the batch.\n\n4. **Return the Rotated Tensor**: After performing the flips, return the modified tensor.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom torch.nn import Module\n\nclass Rot180(Module):\n    def forward(self, input: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # Flip the tensor along the height and width dimensions\n        # This works for both single images and batches of images\n        return input.flip(-1).flip(-2)\n\n# Example usage:\n# rot180 = Rot180()\n# input_tensor = torch.randn(3, 224, 224)  # Single image\n# output_tensor = rot180(input_tensor)\n# print(output_tensor.shape)\n\n# input_batch = torch.randn(10, 3, 224, 224)  # Batch of images\n# output_batch = rot180(input_batch)\n# print(output_batch.shape)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`flip(-1)`**: This operation flips the tensor along the last dimension, which corresponds to the width (`W`).\n- **`flip(-2)`**: This operation flips the tensor along the second-to-last dimension, which corresponds to the height (`H`).\n- By chaining these two operations, the tensor is effectively rotated by 180 degrees.\n\nThis implementation is efficient and leverages PyTorch's built-in tensor operations to handle both single images and batches seamlessly.",
