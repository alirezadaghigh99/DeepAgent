This is a complex step that typically requires specialized numerical methods.\n\n2. **Multiple Candidates**: The SVD step provides multiple candidates for the essential matrix. The correct one is determined by solving the polynomial system.\n\n3. **Placeholder Function**: The `solve_polynomial_system` function is a placeholder. Implementing this function requires solving a 10th-degree polynomial, which is non-trivial and typically done using numerical solvers or libraries specialized in algebraic geometry.\n\nThis implementation provides a framework, but the core of Nister's 5-point algorithm is in solving the polynomial system, which is not trivial to implement from scratch. In practice, libraries like OpenCV provide optimized implementations of this algorithm.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called run_5point that computes the essential matrix using Nister's 5-point algorithm. The function should take two tensors of calibrated points from two images and an optional weights tensor. It should validate the input shapes, construct a linear system, apply weights if provided, and solve for the essential matrix, returning a (B, 3, 3) tensor for each batch",
