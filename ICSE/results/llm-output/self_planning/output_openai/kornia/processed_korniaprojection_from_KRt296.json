If any of these checks fail, an `AssertionError` is raised with a message indicating the expected and actual shapes.\n   - It also ensures that all inputs have the same batch dimension `B`.\n\n2. **Concatenation**:\n   - The function uses `torch.cat` to concatenate the rotation matrix `R` and the translation vector `t` along the last dimension. This forms a new matrix `[R|t]` with shape `(B, 3, 4)`.\n\n3. **Matrix Multiplication**:\n   - The function uses `torch.bmm` to perform batch matrix multiplication of the camera matrix `K` with the concatenated matrix `[R|t]`. This results in the projection matrix `P` with shape `(B, 3, 4)`.\n\n4. **Return**:\n   - Finally, the function returns the computed projection matrix `P`.\n\nThis function is useful in computer vision tasks where you need to compute the projection matrix for a batch of images, given the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera.",
