    "result": "Let's implement the functions `convert_points_to_homogeneous` and `_convert_affinematrix_to_homography_impl` as described in your plan. We'll focus on these two functions, ensuring they handle the specified tasks correctly.\n\n### Function: `convert_points_to_homogeneous`\n\nThis function will convert Euclidean points to homogeneous coordinates. It will validate the input to ensure it's a tensor and has at least two dimensions. Then, it will append a dimension of ones to the last axis of the input tensor.\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef convert_points_to_homogeneous(points):\n    # Validate Input\n    if not isinstance(points, torch.Tensor):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a tensor.\")\n    if points.dim() < 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input tensor must have at least two dimensions.\")\n    \n    # Convert to Homogeneous Coordinates\n    ones = torch.ones(*points.shape[:-1], 1, dtype=points.dtype, device=points.device)\n    homogeneous_points = torch.cat((points, ones), dim=-1)\n    \n    # Return Homogeneous Tensor\n    return homogeneous_points\n```\n\n### Function: `_convert_affinematrix_to_homography_impl`\n\nThis function will transform an affine matrix into a homography matrix by adding a row and column to the affine matrix.\n\n```python\ndef _convert_affinematrix_to_homography_impl(affine_matrix):\n    # Validate Input\n    if not isinstance(affine_matrix, torch.Tensor):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a tensor.\")\n    if affine_matrix.dim() < 2 or affine_matrix.shape[-2:] != (2, 3):\n        raise ValueError(\"Affine matrix must have shape (*, 2, 3).\")\n    \n    # Transform to Homography\n    batch_shape = affine_matrix.shape[:-2]\n    homography_matrix = torch.eye(3, dtype=affine_matrix.dtype, device=affine_matrix.device).expand(*batch_shape, 3, 3).clone()\n    homography_matrix[..., :2, :] = affine_matrix\n    \n    # Return Homography Matrix\n    return homography_matrix\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`convert_points_to_homogeneous`**:\n  - We first check if the input is a tensor and has at least two dimensions.\n  - We create a tensor of ones with the same batch dimensions as the input and concatenate it to the last dimension of the input tensor to form homogeneous coordinates.\n\n- **`_convert_affinematrix_to_homography_impl`**:\n  - We validate that the input is a tensor and has the shape `(*, 2, 3)`, which is typical for affine transformation matrices.\n  - We create a homography matrix by expanding an identity matrix to the batch size and replacing the top 2x3 part with the affine matrix.\n\nThese implementations should meet the requirements specified in your plan. If you have any further questions or need additional functionality, feel free to ask!",
    "prompt": "Create a function `convert_points_to_homogeneous` that converts Euclidean points to homogeneous coordinates. The function takes a tensor `points` with shape `(*, N, D)` and returns a tensor of shape `(*, N, D+1)` representing the points in homogeneous space. It raises a `TypeError` if the input is not a tensor and a `ValueError` if the input tensor has fewer than two dimensions. Additionally, implement `_convert_affinematrix_to_homography_impl` to transform an affine matrix into a homography matrix, ensuring the correct padding and dimensionality.",
