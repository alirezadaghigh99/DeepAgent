If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Cumulative Sum**: The cumulative sum of the `lengths` tensor is calculated using `torch.cumsum`, which provides the initial positions of the knots.\n\n3. **Total Length**: The total length is determined by taking the last value of the cumulative sum, which represents the sum of all lengths.\n\n4. **Scaling and Shifting**: \n   - The cumulative sum is scaled to fit within the range `[lower, upper]` by multiplying it by `(upper - lower) / total_length`.\n   - The scaled cumulative sum is then shifted by adding `lower` to ensure the knot points start at `lower`.\n\n5. **Adjusted Lengths**: The differences between consecutive knot positions are calculated using `torch.diff`, with `prepend` used to include the initial `lower` value. This gives the adjusted lengths.\n\n6. **Return**: The function returns two tensors: the adjusted lengths and the knot positions.\n\nThis function is designed to work with PyTorch tensors, making it suitable for use in environments where PyTorch is used for numerical computations.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function _calculate_knots that takes lengths as a tensor, lower as a float, and upper as a float, and returns two tensors: the adjusted lengths and the knot positions. The function should scale and shift the cumulative sum of the lengths to fit between lower and upper, and ensure the knot points start at lower and end at upper.",
