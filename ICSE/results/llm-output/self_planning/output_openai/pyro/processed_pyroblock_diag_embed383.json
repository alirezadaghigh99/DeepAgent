    "result": "The `block_diag_embed` function you've outlined is designed to create a block diagonal tensor from an input tensor with shape `(..., B, M, N)`. The function constructs an output tensor with shape `(..., B * M, B * N)` by placing each `M x N` matrix from the input tensor along the block diagonal of the output tensor. Here's a detailed explanation of the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef block_diag_embed(mat):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a tensor of shape (..., B, M, N) and returns a block diagonal tensor\n    of shape (..., B * M, B * N).\n\n    :param torch.Tensor mat: an input tensor with 3 or more dimensions\n    :returns torch.Tensor: a block diagonal tensor with dimension `m.dim() - 1`\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the shape of the input tensor\n    *batch_dims, B, M, N = mat.shape\n    \n    # Calculate the shape of the output tensor\n    output_shape = (*batch_dims, B * M, B * N)\n    \n    # Initialize the output tensor with zeros\n    block_diag = torch.zeros(output_shape, dtype=mat.dtype, device=mat.device)\n    \n    # Fill in the block diagonal\n    for b in range(B):\n        # Place each MxN matrix from the input tensor into the correct block\n        block_diag[..., b * M:(b + 1) * M, b * N:(b + 1) * N] = mat[..., b, :, :]\n    \n    return block_diag\n```\n\n### Key Steps Explained:\n\n1. **Extract Dimensions**:\n   - The input tensor's shape is unpacked into `batch_dims`, `B`, `M`, and `N`. This allows the function to handle tensors with arbitrary batch dimensions.\n\n2. **Determine Output Shape**:\n   - The output tensor's shape is calculated as `(*batch_dims, B * M, B * N)`, which ensures that each `M x N` matrix from the input tensor will have its own block in the output tensor.\n\n3. **Initialize Output Tensor**:\n   - A tensor filled with zeros is created with the calculated output shape. This tensor will be populated with the input matrices along its block diagonal.\n\n4. **Populate Block Diagonal**:\n   - A loop iterates over the batch dimension `B`. For each index `b`, the corresponding `M x N` matrix from the input tensor is placed into the correct position in the output tensor. The slicing `[..., b * M:(b + 1) * M, b * N:(b + 1) * N]` ensures that each matrix is placed in its respective block.\n\n5. **Return the Result**:\n   - The function returns the constructed block diagonal tensor.\n\nThis implementation efficiently constructs the block diagonal tensor using PyTorch's tensor operations, making it suitable for use in deep learning models where such operations are common.",
