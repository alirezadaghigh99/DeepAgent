    "result": "The `maximum_weight_matching` function you've outlined is a well-structured approach to solving the maximum-weight matching problem using the Hungarian algorithm. Let's go through the implementation step-by-step to ensure clarity and correctness.\n\n### Key Steps in the Implementation:\n\n1. **Input Conversion:**\n   - The input `logits` tensor is converted to a NumPy array. This is necessary because the `linear_sum_assignment` function from SciPy operates on NumPy arrays.\n\n2. **Hungarian Algorithm:**\n   - The `linear_sum_assignment` function is used to find the optimal assignment. Since this function finds the minimum cost assignment, we negate the `logits` to transform the problem into a maximum-weight matching problem.\n\n3. **Output Construction:**\n   - We create a tensor of the same shape as `logits` to store the optimal assignments. The positions corresponding to the optimal matches are set to `1`, indicating a match.\n\n4. **No Gradient Computation:**\n   - The use of `detach()` ensures that the operations are performed in a non-differentiable context, which means no gradients are computed.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment\n\ndef maximum_weight_matching(logits):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform maximum-weight matching on the input logits tensor and return the optimal assignments.\n\n    Parameters:\n    logits (torch.Tensor): A 2D tensor representing the weights or scores for potential matches.\n\n    Returns:\n    torch.Tensor: A tensor representing the optimal assignments.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert the logits tensor to a numpy array for processing with SciPy\n    logits_np = logits.detach().cpu().numpy()\n\n    # Use the Hungarian algorithm to find the optimal assignment\n    row_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(-logits_np)  # Negate because the function finds minimum cost\n\n    # Create a tensor to represent the optimal assignments\n    assignment_tensor = torch.zeros_like(logits, dtype=torch.int32)\n    assignment_tensor[row_ind, col_ind] = 1\n\n    return assignment_tensor\n\n# Example usage:\n# logits = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 6.0, 5.0], [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]])\n# assignments = maximum_weight_matching(logits)\n# print(assignments)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Example Usage:\n- **Input Tensor:** The example tensor `logits` represents a 3x3 matrix of weights or scores for potential matches.\n- **Output Tensor:** The `assignments` tensor will have the same shape as `logits`, with `1`s indicating the optimal matches.\n\nThis implementation efficiently computes the maximum-weight matching and returns the result in a format that is easy to interpret. The use of the Hungarian algorithm ensures that the solution is optimal for bipartite graphs, which is the typical scenario for such matching problems.",
