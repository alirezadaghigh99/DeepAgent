The importance weights are derived from the difference between the guide's log probabilities and the model's log joint probabilities.\n\n- **Wake-Phi Loss**: This is computed using the log probabilities from the guide traces, normalized by the importance weights. The normalization ensures that the weights sum to one, which is crucial for unbiased estimation.\n\n- **Sleep-Phi Loss**: This is optionally computed if `insomnia` is less than 1. It uses traces from the unconditioned model to calculate the log probabilities of the guide given the model's samples.\n\n- **Phi Loss**: This is a combination of `wake_phi_loss` and `sleep_phi_loss`, controlled by the `insomnia` parameter. The `insomnia` parameter determines the contribution of each component to the final guide loss.\n\nThis implementation provides a structured approach to compute the re-weighted wake-sleep estimators, ensuring that both the model and guide are optimized effectively.",
    "prompt": "```python\nGenerate a Python method `_loss` for the `ReweightedWakeSleep` class, which computes the re-weighted wake-sleep estimators for the model (`wake-theta`) and the guide (`phi`). The method should return the model loss (`wake_theta_loss`) and the guide loss (`phi_loss`).\n\nThe class structure:\n\n```python\nclass ReweightedWakeSleep(ELBO):\n    def __init__(self, num_particles=2, insomnia=1.0, model_has_params=True, num_sleep_particles=None, vectorize_particles=True, max_plate_nesting=float(\"inf\"), strict_enumeration_warning=True):\n        # Initialization code\n        self.insomnia = insomnia  # Scaling factor for the wake-phi and sleep-phi terms\n        self.model_has_params = model_has_params  # Indicates if the model has learnable parameters\n        self.num_sleep_particles = num_particles if num_sleep_particles is None else num_sleep_particles  # Number of particles for sleep-phi estimator\n        assert insomnia >= 0 and insomnia <= 1, \"insomnia should be in [0, 1]\"\n\n    def _get_trace(self, model, guide, args, kwargs):\n        # Returns a single trace from the guide, and the model that is run against it\n\n    def _loss(self, model, guide, args, kwargs):\n        # Returns the computed model loss (wake_theta_loss) and guide loss (phi_loss)\n\n    def loss(self, model, guide, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Calls _loss method and returns the model loss and guide loss\n\n    def loss_and_grads(self, model, guide, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Computes RWS estimators for the model and guide and performs backpropagation on both\n```\n```\n\nIn the `_loss` function:\n- Calculate the `wake_theta_loss` using a weighted average of log joint probabilities from model traces.\n- Calculate the `wake_phi_loss` using normalized importance weights and log probabilities from guide traces.\n- Optionally, calculate the `sleep_phi_loss` using traces from the unconditioned model and the guide.\n- Combine these into the final `phi_loss` based on the `insomnia` parameter.\n- Return `wake_theta_loss` and `phi_loss`.\n\n```",
