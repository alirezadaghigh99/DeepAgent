    "result": "The `forward` method for the `KimCNN` class is implemented correctly in the provided code. Let's break down the steps to ensure clarity and understanding of each part of the process:\n\n1. **Embedding the Input Sequences**: \n   - The input tensor `x`, which contains word indices, is passed through the embedding layer to convert these indices into dense vectors. This results in a tensor of shape `(B, max_seq_length, embed_dim)`, where `B` is the batch size.\n\n2. **Add Channel Dimension**:\n   - The tensor is reshaped to add a channel dimension, resulting in a shape of `(B, 1, max_seq_length, embed_dim)`. This is necessary because the convolutional layers expect a 4D input with a channel dimension.\n\n3. **Apply Convolutional Layers**:\n   - For each kernel size, a 2D convolution is applied to the embedded input. The `nn.Conv2d` layers are used here, and the activation function `ReLU` is applied to introduce non-linearity. This step generates feature maps for each kernel.\n\n4. **Apply Max-Pooling**:\n   - After convolution, max-pooling is applied to each feature map to reduce its dimensionality and capture the most important features. The pooling operation is performed using `nn.MaxPool2d`, and the result is squeezed to remove unnecessary dimensions.\n\n5. **Concatenate Pooled Features**:\n   - The pooled features from all kernel sizes are concatenated along the feature dimension. This results in a single feature vector of shape `(B, out_channels * num_kernels)`.\n\n6. **Apply Dropout**:\n   - Dropout is applied to the concatenated feature vector to prevent overfitting. This randomly sets some of the features to zero during training.\n\n7. **Fully Connected Layer**:\n   - The final feature vector is passed through a fully connected layer to produce the output logits for each class. The `nn.Linear` layer is used here, and the output shape is `(B, num_classes)`.\n\nThe implementation is efficient and follows the typical architecture of a convolutional neural network for text classification, as proposed by Yoon Kim in his paper on CNNs for sentence classification. This architecture is particularly effective for capturing local features in text data.",
    "prompt": "```python\nGenerate a Python method `forward` for the `KimCNN` class that performs a forward pass through the convolutional neural network designed for text classification.
