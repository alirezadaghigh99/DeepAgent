    "result": "Here's the implementation of the `_bald` function, which calculates the Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) score. This function is designed to quantify the uncertainty in predictions by computing the mutual information between predictions and model parameters.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef _bald(p, eps=1e-8):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) score.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - p: A 2D numpy array of predictions, where each row corresponds to a set of predictions for a single data point.\n    - eps: A small value to prevent division by zero or log of zero, default is 1e-8.\n\n    Returns:\n    - A numpy array of BALD scores for each data point.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the mean prediction across all samples for each data point\n    mean_pred = np.mean(p, axis=0)\n    \n    # Calculate the entropy of the mean prediction\n    entropy_mean_pred = -np.sum(mean_pred * np.log(mean_pred + eps), axis=-1)\n    \n    # Calculate the entropy of each prediction\n    entropy_preds = -np.sum(p * np.log(p + eps), axis=-1)\n    \n    # Calculate the mean entropy of predictions\n    mean_entropy_preds = np.mean(entropy_preds, axis=0)\n    \n    # Calculate the BALD score\n    bald_score = entropy_mean_pred - mean_entropy_preds\n    \n    return bald_score\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Steps:\n\n1. **Mean Prediction Calculation**:\n   - The function first computes the mean prediction for each data point by averaging the predictions across all samples. This gives a single probability distribution for each data point.\n\n2. **Entropy of the Mean Prediction**:\n   - The entropy of the mean prediction is calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     H(\\text{mean\\_pred}) = -\\sum (\\text{mean\\_pred} \\times \\log(\\text{mean\\_pred} + \\text{eps}))\n     \\]\n   - This step measures the uncertainty of the average prediction.\n\n3. **Entropy of Each Prediction**:\n   - For each set of predictions, the entropy is calculated similarly. This measures the uncertainty of each individual prediction.\n\n4. **Mean Entropy of Predictions**:\n   - The mean of these entropies is computed across all samples, providing an average measure of uncertainty for the predictions.\n\n5. **BALD Score Calculation**:\n   - The BALD score is the difference between the entropy of the mean prediction and the mean entropy of the predictions. This score reflects the amount of information gained about the model parameters by observing the data point.\n\nThis function is useful in active learning scenarios where you want to select data points that maximize the information gain, thereby improving the model's performance with fewer labeled examples.",
