    "result": "Let's focus on implementing the `make_non_linear_kernels` function as described in your task. This function will create a list of structured multi-fidelity kernels using a specified base kernel class from GPy. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport GPy\n\ndef make_non_linear_kernels(base_kernel_class, n_fidelities, n_input_dims, ARD=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs a list of structured multi-fidelity kernels using a specified base kernel class from GPy.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - base_kernel_class: The GPy kernel class to use.\n    - n_fidelities: Number of fidelity levels.\n    - n_input_dims: Number of input dimensions.\n    - ARD: Boolean indicating whether to use Automatic Relevance Determination.\n\n    Returns:\n    - A list of kernels, with one kernel per fidelity level, starting from the lowest to the highest fidelity.\n    \"\"\"\n    kernels = []\n\n    # Create the first fidelity kernel\n    first_fidelity_kernel = base_kernel_class(input_dim=n_input_dims, ARD=ARD)\n    kernels.append(first_fidelity_kernel)\n\n    # Create subsequent fidelity kernels\n    for i in range(1, n_fidelities):\n        # Current fidelity kernel\n        current_fidelity_kernel = base_kernel_class(input_dim=n_input_dims, ARD=ARD)\n        \n        # Previous fidelity kernel\n        previous_fidelity_kernel = kernels[i - 1]\n        \n        # Construct the kernel for the current fidelity level\n        combined_kernel = current_fidelity_kernel * previous_fidelity_kernel + base_kernel_class(input_dim=n_input_dims, ARD=ARD)\n        \n        # Add the constructed kernel to the list\n        kernels.append(combined_kernel)\n\n    return kernels\n\n# Example usage:\n# Assuming you have GPy installed and a base kernel class like GPy.kern.RBF\n# kernels = make_non_linear_kernels(GPy.kern.RBF, n_fidelities=3, n_input_dims=2, ARD=True)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialize Kernel List**: We start by creating an empty list `kernels` to store the kernels for each fidelity level.\n\n2. **First Fidelity Kernel**: The first kernel is simply the base kernel applied to the input dimensions. We create this using the `base_kernel_class` and append it to the `kernels` list.\n\n3. **Subsequent Fidelity Kernels**: For each subsequent fidelity level, we:\n   - Create a new kernel for the current fidelity.\n   - Multiply this kernel with the kernel from the previous fidelity level.\n   - Add another base kernel to serve as a bias.\n   - Append the resulting kernel to the `kernels` list.\n\n4. **Return Kernel List**: Finally, we return the list of constructed kernels.\n\nThis function allows you to create a series of kernels that can be used in multi-fidelity modeling, where each fidelity level builds upon the previous one. Adjust the `base_kernel_class` and parameters as needed for your specific use case.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function `make_non_linear_kernels` that constructs a list of structured multi-fidelity kernels using a specified base kernel class from GPy. The function should accept the following parameters: `base_kernel_class` (the GPy kernel class to use), `n_fidelities` (number of fidelity levels), `n_input_dims` (number of input dimensions), and `ARD` (a boolean indicating whether to use Automatic Relevance Determination, i.e., different lengthscales for different dimensions). The function should return a list of kernels, with one kernel per fidelity level, starting from the lowest to the highest fidelity. For the first fidelity, the kernel is simply the base kernel applied to the input dimensions. For subsequent fidelities, the kernel is constructed by multiplying the base kernel applied to the current fidelity with the base kernel applied to the previous fidelity, and adding another base kernel for bias. Default value of ARD is False",
