    "result": "To implement the `batch_training` function for the `RBM` class, we need to ensure that the TensorFlow session and operations are properly set up. The function will iterate over a specified number of minibatches, perform training, and optionally compute metrics. Here's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nclass RBM:\n    def __init__(self, possible_ratings, visible_units, hidden_units=500, keep_prob=0.7, init_stdv=0.1, learning_rate=0.004, minibatch_size=100, training_epoch=20, display_epoch=10, sampling_protocol=[50, 70, 80, 90, 100], debug=False, with_metrics=False, seed=42):\n        self.sess = tf.Session()  # Initialize TensorFlow session\n        self.opt = None  # Placeholder for optimizer operation\n        self.rmse = None  # Placeholder for RMSE operation\n        self.with_metrics = with_metrics  # Flag to determine if metrics should be evaluated\n        # Additional initialization code here (e.g., defining the model, optimizer, and RMSE)\n        pass\n\n    def batch_training(self, num_minibatches):\n        total_error = 0.0\n\n        for _ in range(num_minibatches):\n            # Run the training operation\n            self.sess.run(self.opt)\n\n            if self.with_metrics:\n                # Compute the RMSE for the current minibatch\n                minibatch_error = self.sess.run(self.rmse)\n                total_error += minibatch_error\n\n        if self.with_metrics:\n            # Calculate the average training error\n            average_error = total_error / num_minibatches\n            return average_error\n        else:\n            return 0\n\n# Example usage:\n# rbm = RBM(possible_ratings=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], visible_units=1000, with_metrics=True)\n# average_error = rbm.batch_training(num_minibatches=10)\n# print(\"Average Training Error:\", average_error)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **TensorFlow Session**: The `self.sess` is initialized as a TensorFlow session. Ensure that the session is properly managed, especially if using TensorFlow 2.x, where eager execution is the default. You might need to adjust the session management if using TensorFlow 2.x.\n\n2. **Optimizer and RMSE Operations**: The `self.opt` and `self.rmse` are placeholders for the optimizer and RMSE operations, respectively. These should be defined elsewhere in the class, typically during the model setup.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: The implementation assumes that the operations will run without errors. In a production setting, consider adding error handling to manage potential issues during session execution.\n\n4. **Performance Considerations**: Ensure that the data feeding into the session is efficient, especially for large datasets. TensorFlow's data pipeline utilities can help manage this efficiently.\n\n5. **TensorFlow Version**: This code is written for TensorFlow 1.x. If you are using TensorFlow 2.x, you may need to adapt the session management and operation execution to fit the eager execution paradigm or use `tf.compat.v1` to maintain compatibility with TensorFlow 1.x code.\n\nThis implementation provides a basic structure for batch training in an RBM class, focusing on training and optional metric computation. Adjust the initialization and session management as needed based on your specific TensorFlow setup and version.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `batch_training` for the class `RBM` that performs training over a specified number of minibatches. The function should return the average training error per epoch if `self.with_metrics` is `True`; otherwise, it should return `0`. The function involves running the training operation (`self.opt`) using a TensorFlow session (`self.sess`). If `self.with_metrics` is enabled, it should also compute the root mean square error (`self.rmse`) and accumulate the training error over all minibatches, averaging it at the end.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass RBM:\n    def __init__(self, possible_ratings, visible_units, hidden_units=500, keep_prob=0.7, init_stdv=0.1, learning_rate=0.004, minibatch_size=100, training_epoch=20, display_epoch=10, sampling_protocol=[50, 70, 80, 90, 100], debug=False, with_metrics=False, seed=42):\n        self.sess = None  # TensorFlow session\n        self.opt = None  # optimizer operation for training\n        self.rmse = None  # root mean square error operation for evaluation\n        self.with_metrics = with_metrics  # flag to determine if metrics should be evaluated\n        pass\n\n    def batch_training(self, num_minibatches):\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
