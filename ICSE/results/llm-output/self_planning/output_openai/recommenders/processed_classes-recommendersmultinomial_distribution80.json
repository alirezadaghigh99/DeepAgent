This step is crucial for converting the linear combination into unnormalized probabilities.\n\n2. **Normalization**:\n   - `tf.reduce_sum(exp_phi, axis=0, keepdims=True)` calculates the sum of the exponentials along the first axis (which corresponds to `r`, the number of possible ratings). This sum is used to normalize the probabilities so that they sum to 1 for each visible unit.\n\n3. **Reshaping**:\n   - `tf.transpose(probabilities, perm=[1, 2, 0])` rearranges the dimensions of the tensor to `(m, Nv, r)`. This reshaping is necessary to align the dimensions for efficient sampling in subsequent operations.\n\n4. **Return**:\n   - The function returns the reshaped tensor, which represents the probability distribution for each visible unit having a specific value given the linear combination `phi`.\n\nThis implementation assumes that `phi` is a tensor with dimensions `(r, m, Nv)`, where `r` is the number of possible ratings, `m` is the number of samples (or minibatch size), and `Nv` is the number of visible units. The function is designed to be used within the context of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) for tasks such as collaborative filtering or other applications involving multinomial distributions.",
