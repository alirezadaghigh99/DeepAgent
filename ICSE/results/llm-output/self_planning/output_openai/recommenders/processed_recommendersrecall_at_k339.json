    "result": "Here's a complete implementation of the `recall_at_k` function, including the `merge_ranking_true_pred` function.

You can extend this to include other methods if needed.\n- **Recall Calculation**: For each user, the function calculates recall as the ratio of relevant items in the top K predictions to the total number of relevant items. If there are no relevant items, recall is set to 0.\n- **Edge Cases**: The function handles cases where there are fewer than K relevant items by capping the denominator at the minimum of the number of relevant items and K.\n- **Return Value**: The function returns the average recall across all users, or 0.0 if there are no hits.\n\nThis implementation should work for your use case, assuming the input data is structured correctly.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called recall_at_k that calculates the recall at K for a recommendation system. The function takes in the following parameters: rating_true (a pandas DataFrame representing true ratings), rating_pred (a pandas DataFrame representing predicted ratings), col_user (a string representing the column name for user), col_item (a string representing the column name for item), col_prediction (a string representing the column name for prediction), relevancy_method (a string representing the method for determining relevancy), k (an integer representing the number of top K items per user), threshold (a float representing the threshold of top items per user).\n\nThe function returns a float value representing the recall at K (with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1). The maximum value is 1 even when fewer than K items exist for a user in rating_true. The function internally calls the merge_ranking_true_pred function to calculate the recall at K. If there are no hits in the data, the function returns 0.0.",
