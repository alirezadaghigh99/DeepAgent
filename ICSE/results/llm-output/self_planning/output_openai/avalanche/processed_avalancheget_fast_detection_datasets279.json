    "result": "The provided function `get_fast_detection_datasets` is designed to generate synthetic datasets for object detection tasks. Let's walk through the implementation to ensure it meets the specified requirements and make any necessary improvements.\n\n### Key Steps in the Implementation\n\n1. **Input Validation**:\n   - The function checks that the number of test images is less than the total number of images and greater than zero.\n   - It also ensures that the total number of samples is sufficient to cover the required samples per class.\n\n2. **Random Seed Initialization**:\n   - The function uses the provided `seed` to ensure reproducibility by setting the seed for both the `random` and `numpy` libraries.\n\n3. **Synthetic Image Generation**:\n   - A list of synthetic images is created using `numpy` to generate random pixel values for each image.\n\n4. **Detection Target Generation**:\n   - For each image, a random number of objects is generated, each with a class label and a bounding box.\n   - The function ensures that the required number of samples per class is met by tracking the count of samples for each class.\n\n5. **Dataset Splitting**:\n   - The function randomly selects indices for the test dataset and uses the remaining indices for the training dataset.\n\n6. **Return Datasets**:\n   - Two datasets are returned: one for training and one for testing, each containing images and their corresponding detection targets.\n\n### Improvements and Considerations\n\n- **Bounding Box Generation**: Ensure that bounding boxes are valid and within image dimensions.\n- **Class Sample Count**: The function should ensure that the required number of samples per class is met across all images.\n- **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases where `n_images` is very small or `max_elements_per_image` is very low.\n\nHere's the refined implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport random\n\ndef get_fast_detection_datasets(n_images, max_elements_per_image, n_samples_per_class, n_classes, seed, image_size, n_test_images):\n    # Validate inputs\n    assert n_test_images < n_images and n_test_images > 0, \"Number of test images must be less than total images and greater than zero.\"\n    assert n_images * max_elements_per_image >= n_samples_per_class * n_classes, \"Total samples must be sufficient to cover required samples per class.\"\n\n    # Initialize random seed\n    random.seed(seed)\n    np.random.seed(seed)\n\n    # Generate synthetic images\n    images = [np.random.rand(*image_size) for _ in range(n_images)]\n\n    # Generate detection targets\n    targets = []\n    class_counts = {i: 0 for i in range(n_classes)}\n    for _ in range(n_images):\n        num_elements = random.randint(1, max_elements_per_image)\n        image_targets = []\n        for _ in range(num_elements):\n            class_label = random.randint(0, n_classes - 1)\n            if class_counts[class_label] < n_samples_per_class:\n                class_counts[class_label] += 1\n                # Generate random bounding box\n                x_min = random.uniform(0, image_size[1] - 1)\n                y_min = random.uniform(0, image_size[0] - 1)\n                x_max = random.uniform(x_min + 1, image_size[1])\n                y_max = random.uniform(y_min + 1, image_size[0])\n                bbox = [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]\n                image_targets.append((class_label, bbox))\n        targets.append(image_targets)\n\n    # Ensure all classes have the required number of samples\n    for class_label in range(n_classes):\n        while class_counts[class_label] < n_samples_per_class:\n            # Randomly select an image to add more samples\n            image_index = random.randint(0, n_images - 1)\n            x_min = random.uniform(0, image_size[1] - 1)\n            y_min = random.uniform(0, image_size[0] - 1)\n            x_max = random.uniform(x_min + 1, image_size[1])\n            y_max = random.uniform(y_min + 1, image_size[0])\n            bbox = [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]\n            targets[image_index].append((class_label, bbox))\n            class_counts[class_label] += 1\n\n    # Split into training and testing datasets\n    indices = list(range(n_images))\n    random.shuffle(indices)\n    test_indices = indices[:n_test_images]\n    train_indices = indices[n_test_images:]\n\n    train_dataset = [(images[i], targets[i]) for i in train_indices]\n    test_dataset = [(images[i], targets[i]) for i in test_indices]\n\n    return train_dataset, test_dataset\n```\n\nThis implementation ensures that the datasets are generated correctly, with the required number of samples per class and valid bounding boxes. The function is robust to various input configurations and maintains reproducibility through the use of a random seed.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function `get_fast_detection_datasets` that generates synthetic datasets for object detection tasks. The function should accept the following inputs: `n_images` (number of total images), `max_elements_per_image` (maximum number of objects per image), `n_samples_per_class` (number of samples per class), `n_classes` (number of different classes), `seed` (random seed for reproducibility), `image_size` (size of each image), and `n_test_images` (number of images to be used for testing). The function should ensure that the number of generated images and elements per image are sufficient to cover the required samples per class and that the number of test images is within valid bounds. Use assertions to check that the total number of samples is greater than or equal to the required samples per class and that the number of test images is less than the total number of images and greater than zero. The function should return two datasets, one for training and one for testing, each containing images and corresponding detection targets.",
