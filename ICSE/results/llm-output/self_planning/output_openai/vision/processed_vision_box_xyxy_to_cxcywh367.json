    "result": "The function `_box_xyxy_to_cxcywh` is designed to convert bounding boxes from the `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` format to the `(cx, cy, w, h)` format using PyTorch. Here's a detailed breakdown of the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _box_xyxy_to_cxcywh(boxes):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert bounding boxes from (x1, y1, x2, y2) format to (cx, cy, w, h) format.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - boxes (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (N, 4) where N is the number of bounding boxes.\n\n    Returns:\n    - torch.Tensor: A tensor of shape (N, 4) with bounding boxes in (cx, cy, w, h) format.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure the input is a tensor\n    if not isinstance(boxes, torch.Tensor):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input boxes should be a torch.Tensor\")\n\n    # Calculate center coordinates\n    cx = (boxes[:, 0] + boxes[:, 2]) / 2\n    cy = (boxes[:, 1] + boxes[:, 3]) / 2\n\n    # Calculate width and height\n    w = boxes[:, 2] - boxes[:, 0]\n    h = boxes[:, 3] - boxes[:, 1]\n\n    # Stack the results into a new tensor\n    converted_boxes = torch.stack((cx, cy, w, h), dim=1)\n\n    return converted_boxes\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Parsing**:\n   - The function expects a tensor `boxes` of shape `(N, 4)`, where `N` is the number of bounding boxes. Each bounding box is represented by four values: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.\n\n2. **Type Checking**:\n   - The function checks if the input is a PyTorch tensor. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n\n3. **Calculate Center Coordinates**:\n   - The center `cx` is calculated as the average of `x1` and `x2`.\n   - The center `cy` is calculated as the average of `y1` and `y2`.\n\n4. **Calculate Width and Height**:\n   - The width `w` is calculated as the difference between `x2` and `x1`.\n   - The height `h` is calculated as the difference between `y2` and `y1`.\n\n5. **Create Output Tensor**:\n   - The results `(cx, cy, w, h)` are stacked into a new tensor using `torch.stack`, with `dim=1` to ensure each bounding box is represented as a row in the output tensor.\n\n6. **Return the Result**:\n   - The function returns the new tensor containing the converted bounding boxes.\n\nThis function is useful in computer vision tasks where bounding box formats need to be converted for different algorithms or models that require specific input formats.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function _box_xyxy_to_cxcywh that converts bounding boxes from the (x1, y1, x2, y2) format, where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) represent the top-left and bottom-right corners, to the (cx, cy, w, h) format, where (cx, cy) represents the center and (w, h) represents the width and height. The function should return a tensor with the converted bounding boxes.",
