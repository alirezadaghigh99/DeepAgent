    "result": "Let's focus on implementing the `_box_xywh_to_xyxy` function, which converts bounding boxes from the (x, y, w, h) format to the (x1, y1, x2, y2) format. We'll use PyTorch to handle the tensor operations. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _box_xywh_to_xyxy(boxes):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert bounding boxes from (x, y, w, h) format to (x1, y1, x2, y2) format.\n\n    Args:\n        boxes (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (N, 4) where N is the number of boxes,\n                              and each box is represented as (x, y, w, h).\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: A tensor of shape (N, 4) with boxes in (x1, y1, x2, y2) format.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure the input is a tensor\n    if not isinstance(boxes, torch.Tensor):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input boxes should be a torch.Tensor\")\n\n    # Check the shape of the input tensor\n    if boxes.ndimension() != 2 or boxes.size(1) != 4:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input boxes should have shape (N, 4)\")\n\n    # Extract x, y, w, h\n    x, y, w, h = boxes.unbind(dim=1)\n\n    # Calculate x1, y1, x2, y2\n    x1 = x\n    y1 = y\n    x2 = x + w\n    y2 = y + h\n\n    # Stack the results into a new tensor\n    converted_boxes = torch.stack((x1, y1, x2, y2), dim=1)\n\n    return converted_boxes\n\n# Example usage:\n# boxes_xywh = torch.tensor([[10, 20, 30, 40], [50, 60, 70, 80]])\n# boxes_xyxy = _box_xywh_to_xyxy(boxes_xywh)\n# print(boxes_xyxy)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the input is a PyTorch tensor and if it has the correct shape `(N, 4)`, where `N` is the number of bounding boxes.\n\n2. **Unbinding the Tensor**: The `unbind` method is used to split the tensor into individual components: `x`, `y`, `w`, and `h`.\n\n3. **Calculating New Coordinates**: \n   - `x1` and `y1` are the same as `x` and `y`, respectively.\n   - `x2` is calculated as `x + w`.\n   - `y2` is calculated as `y + h`.\n\n4. **Stacking the Results**: The new coordinates are stacked back into a tensor of shape `(N, 4)`.\n\n5. **Return**: The function returns the converted tensor.\n\nThis function efficiently converts bounding boxes from one format to another using PyTorch's tensor operations, which are optimized for performance.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function _box_xywh_to_xyxy that converts bounding boxes from the (x, y, w, h) format, where (x, y) represents the top-left corner and (w, h) represents the width and height, to the (x1, y1, x2, y2) format, where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) represent the top-left and bottom-right corners. The function should return a tensor with the converted bounding boxes.",
