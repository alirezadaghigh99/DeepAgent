    "result": "The function `box_area` is designed to compute the area of bounding boxes given their coordinates in the format `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`. Let's walk through the implementation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the input tensor `boxes` has the correct shape `(N, 4)`. This ensures that each bounding box is represented by four coordinates.\n\n2. **Extract Coordinates**: The coordinates `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are extracted from the input tensor. These represent the top-left and bottom-right corners of each bounding box.\n\n3. **Compute Width and Height**: The width and height of each bounding box are calculated using the formulas:\n   - Width = `x2 - x1`\n   - Height = `y2 - y1`\n   These calculations assume that the input constraints `0 <= x1 < x2` and `0 <= y1 < y2` are satisfied, ensuring non-negative dimensions.\n\n4. **Calculate Area**: The area of each bounding box is computed by multiplying the width and height.\n\n5. **Return Result**: The function returns a tensor containing the area for each bounding box, with the shape `(N)`.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef box_area(boxes):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the area of a set of bounding boxes.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - boxes (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (N, 4) where N is the number of boxes.\n                            Each box is represented by (x1, y1, x2, y2).\n\n    Returns:\n    - torch.Tensor: A tensor of shape (N) containing the area for each box.\n    \"\"\"\n    if boxes.shape[1] != 4:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input tensor must have shape (N, 4)\")\n\n    # Extract coordinates\n    x1, y1, x2, y2 = boxes[:, 0], boxes[:, 1], boxes[:, 2], boxes[:, 3]\n\n    # Compute width and height\n    width = x2 - x1\n    height = y2 - y1\n\n    # Calculate area\n    area = width * height\n\n    return area\n\n# Example usage:\n# boxes = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 5, 7]])\n# print(box_area(boxes))  # Output: tensor([2, 6])\n```\n\nThis function is efficient and leverages PyTorch's tensor operations to compute the areas in a vectorized manner, which is beneficial for performance when dealing with large numbers of bounding boxes.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called box_area that computes the area of a set of bounding boxes specified by their (x1, y1, x2, y2) coordinates. The input is a tensor of shape (N, 4) called boxes, where N is the number of boxes. The boxes are expected to be in (x1, y1, x2, y2) format with 0 <= x1 < x2 and 0 <= y1 < y2.
