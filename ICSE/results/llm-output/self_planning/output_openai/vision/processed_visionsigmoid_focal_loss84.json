    "result": "Here's a detailed implementation of the `sigmoid_focal_loss` function in Python, following the steps outlined:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef sigmoid_focal_loss(inputs, targets, alpha=0.25, gamma=2.0, reduction='none'):\n    # Ensure inputs and targets are tensors\n    inputs = torch.tensor(inputs, dtype=torch.float32)\n    targets = torch.tensor(targets, dtype=torch.float32)\n    \n    # Compute the sigmoid of inputs to get probabilities\n    prob = torch.sigmoid(inputs)\n    \n    # Compute the probability of the target class\n    p_t = prob * targets + (1 - prob) * (1 - targets)\n    \n    # Compute the alpha factor for balancing\n    alpha_t = alpha * targets + (1 - alpha) * (1 - targets)\n    \n    # Calculate the focal loss\n    focal_loss = -alpha_t * (1 - p_t) ** gamma * torch.log(p_t + 1e-12)\n    \n    # Apply reduction\n    if reduction == 'mean':\n        return focal_loss.mean()\n    elif reduction == 'sum':\n        return focal_loss.sum()\n    elif reduction == 'none':\n        return focal_loss\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Invalid reduction type: {reduction}\")\n\n# Example usage\ninputs = torch.tensor([0.1, 0.7, 0.2])\ntargets = torch.tensor([0, 1, 0])\nloss = sigmoid_focal_loss(inputs, targets, alpha=0.25, gamma=2.0, reduction='mean')\nprint(loss)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Inputs and Targets**: The function starts by ensuring that both `inputs` and `targets` are PyTorch tensors of type `float32`.\n\n2. **Sigmoid Function**: The `inputs` are passed through the sigmoid function to convert them into probabilities.\n\n3. **Probability of Target Class**: The probability of the target class, \\( p_t \\), is computed. This is done by multiplying the probabilities with the targets for positive examples and with \\(1 - \\text{probabilities}\\) for negative examples.\n\n4. **Alpha and Gamma Parameters**: \n   - `alpha_t` is calculated to balance the importance of positive and negative examples.\n   - The focal loss is computed using the formula, which includes the focusing parameter `gamma` to reduce the loss contribution from easy examples.\n\n5. **Reduction Options**: The function supports three reduction options:\n   - `'none'`: Returns the loss for each element without any reduction.\n   - `'mean'`: Returns the average loss across all elements.\n   - `'sum'`: Returns the total loss across all elements.\n\n6. **Return the Loss**: The function returns the computed loss tensor with the specified reduction applied.\n\nThis implementation is flexible and can be used in various scenarios where class imbalance is a concern, such as object detection tasks.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called sigmoid_focal_loss that calculates the focal loss used in RetinaNet for dense detection. The function takes in four parameters: inputs (a float tensor of arbitrary shape representing predictions), targets (a float tensor with the same shape as inputs representing binary classification labels), alpha (a float weighting factor to balance positive vs negative examples), gamma (a float exponent to balance easy vs hard examples), and reduction (a string specifying the reduction option for the output). The function returns a loss tensor with the specified reduction option applied. The function implements the focal loss formula and handles different reduction options such as 'none', 'mean', or 'sum'.",
