    "result": "Let's implement the function `_box_cxcywh_to_xyxy` based on the provided plan. This function will convert bounding boxes from the (cx, cy, w, h) format to the (x1, y1, x2, y2) format. We'll use PyTorch to handle the tensor operations.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _box_cxcywh_to_xyxy(boxes):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert bounding boxes from (cx, cy, w, h) format to (x1, y1, x2, y2) format.\n\n    Args:\n        boxes (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (N, 4) where N is the number of boxes,\n                              and each box is represented as (cx, cy, w, h).\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: A tensor of shape (N, 4) with boxes in (x1, y1, x2, y2) format.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Extract center coordinates and size\n    cx, cy, w, h = boxes.unbind(-1)\n\n    # Calculate corners\n    x1 = cx - 0.5 * w\n    y1 = cy - 0.5 * h\n    x2 = cx + 0.5 * w\n    y2 = cy + 0.5 * h\n\n    # Stack the results into a single tensor\n    return torch.stack((x1, y1, x2, y2), dim=-1)\n\n# Example usage\nboxes_cxcywh = torch.tensor([[50, 50, 20, 20], [30, 30, 10, 10]])\nboxes_xyxy = _box_cxcywh_to_xyxy(boxes_cxcywh)\nprint(boxes_xyxy)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Extract Center and Size**: We use `unbind` to split the input tensor into separate tensors for `cx`, `cy`, `w`, and `h`.\n\n2. **Calculate Corners**: \n   - The top-left corner `(x1, y1)` is calculated as `(cx - w/2, cy - h/2)`.\n   - The bottom-right corner `(x2, y2)` is calculated as `(cx + w/2, cy + h/2)`.\n\n3. **Return Converted Tensor**: We use `torch.stack` to combine the calculated corner coordinates into a single tensor with the desired format.\n\nThis function will efficiently convert bounding boxes for any number of inputs, leveraging PyTorch's tensor operations for performance.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function _box_cxcywh_to_xyxy that converts bounding boxes from the (cx, cy, w, h) format, where (cx, cy) represents the center and (w, h) represents the width and height, to the (x1, y1, x2, y2) format, where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) represent the top-left and bottom-right corners, respectively. The function should return a tensor with the converted bounding boxes.",
