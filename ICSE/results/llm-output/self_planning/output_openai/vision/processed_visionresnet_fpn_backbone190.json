If the name is not valid, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Load ResNet Backbone**: The appropriate ResNet model is loaded using the `backbone_name`. If `weights` are provided, they are used to initialize the model.\n\n3. **Freeze Layers**: The function determines which layers to freeze based on the `trainable_layers` parameter. It iterates over the layers that should be frozen and sets `requires_grad` to `False` for their parameters.\n\n4. **Select Layers for FPN**: The function checks if `returned_layers` is provided. If not, it defaults to `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. It also validates that each layer in `returned_layers` is within the valid range.\n\n5. **Construct FPN**: The function calculates the input channels for each stage of the FPN and constructs the `BackboneWithFPN` object using these channels, the `return_layers` mapping, and the `extra_blocks` if provided.\n\n6. **Return the Backbone with FPN**: Finally, the constructed `BackboneWithFPN` object is returned.\n\nThis implementation provides a flexible way to create a ResNet backbone with an FPN, allowing for customization of trainable layers and returned feature maps.",
