    "result": "Certainly! Let's walk through the implementation of the `_get_perspective_coeffs` function step by step, ensuring that it adheres to the requirements and uses PyTorch for numerical computations.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _get_perspective_coeffs(startpoints, endpoints):\n    # Step 1: Validate Input\n    if len(startpoints) != 4 or len(endpoints) != 4:\n        raise ValueError(\"Both startpoints and endpoints must contain exactly four coordinate pairs.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Prepare the System of Equations\n    A = []\n    B = []\n    for (x, y), (x_prime, y_prime) in zip(startpoints, endpoints):\n        # Each point contributes two equations\n        A.append([x, y, 1, 0, 0, 0, -x_prime * x, -x_prime * y])\n        A.append([0, 0, 0, x, y, 1, -y_prime * x, -y_prime * y])\n        B.append(x_prime)\n        B.append(y_prime)\n\n    # Convert lists to PyTorch tensors\n    A = torch.tensor(A, dtype=torch.float64)\n    B = torch.tensor(B, dtype=torch.float64)\n\n    # Step 3: Solve the System Using Least Squares\n    # PyTorch's lstsq function has been deprecated, so we use torch.linalg.lstsq instead\n    solution = torch.linalg.lstsq(A, B)\n    coeffs = solution.solution\n\n    # Step 4: Convert to Single Precision\n    coeffs = coeffs[:8].flatten().to(torch.float32)\n\n    # Step 5: Return the Coefficients\n    return coeffs\n\n# Example usage:\nstartpoints = [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]\nendpoints = [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]\ncoeffs = _get_perspective_coeffs(startpoints, endpoints)\nprint(coeffs)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if both `startpoints` and `endpoints` contain exactly four coordinate pairs. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **System of Equations**: For each pair of points, two equations are added to the matrix `A` and vector `B`. These equations are derived from the perspective transformation formulas.\n\n3. **Matrix Construction**: The matrix `A` and vector `B` are constructed using the input points. Each point contributes two rows to `A` and two entries to `B`.\n\n4. **Solving the System**: The least squares solution is computed using `torch.linalg.lstsq`, which is the recommended method in recent PyTorch versions for solving linear systems.\n\n5. **Precision Conversion**: The resulting coefficients are converted from double precision to single precision to ensure compatibility with typical image processing tasks.\n\n6. **Return**: The function returns the coefficients as a PyTorch tensor.\n\nThis implementation ensures numerical stability and leverages PyTorch's capabilities for efficient matrix operations.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function named `_get_perspective_coeffs` that calculates the eight coefficients required for performing a perspective transformation on an image. The function takes two lists of four coordinate pairs each, `startpoints` and `endpoints`, corresponding to the corners of the original and transformed images, respectively. It computes the coefficients `(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h)` using least squares to map each pixel `(x, y)` in the original image to its new position in the transformed image. The function should validate that exactly four corners are provided for both inputs, raising a `ValueError` if this condition is not met. Calculations should be performed in double precision to ensure numerical stability, with results converted to single precision before returning. Use the PyTorch library for matrix operations and numerical computations.",
