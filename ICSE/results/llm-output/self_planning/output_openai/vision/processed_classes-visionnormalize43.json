    "result": "The `normalize` method for the `GeneralizedRCNNTransform` class has been implemented as per your requirements. Here's a detailed breakdown of the implementation:\n\n### `normalize` Method\n\n**Purpose:**\n- The `normalize` method is designed to normalize an input image tensor by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This is a common preprocessing step in image processing and deep learning to ensure that the input data is centered and scaled appropriately.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. **Check Image Type:** \n   - The method first checks if the input image is of a floating-point type. This is important because normalization typically assumes that the image pixel values are in the range [0, 1], which is common for floating-point representations.\n   - If the image is not of a floating-point type, a `TypeError` is raised with a descriptive message.\n\n2. **Normalize Image:**\n   - The method converts the `image_mean` and `image_std` lists into tensors that are compatible with the input image's device (e.g., CPU or GPU).\n   - It then normalizes the image by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This operation is performed channel-wise, which is why the mean and standard deviation tensors are reshaped to match the dimensions of the image tensor.\n\n3. **Return Normalized Image:**\n   - The method returns the normalized image tensor.\n\nHere's the complete implementation of the `normalize` method within the `GeneralizedRCNNTransform` class:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import nn\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Optional, Any\n\nclass GeneralizedRCNNTransform(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, min_size: int, max_size: int, image_mean: List[float], image_std: List[float], size_divisible: int = 32, fixed_size: Optional[Tuple[int, int]] = None, **kwargs: Any):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.min_size = min_size\n        self.max_size = max_size\n        self.image_mean = image_mean\n        self.image_std = image_std\n        self.size_divisible = size_divisible\n        self.fixed_size = fixed_size\n        self._skip_resize = kwargs.pop(\"_skip_resize\", False)\n\n    def normalize(self, image: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        if not image.is_floating_point():\n            raise TypeError(\n                f\"Expected input images to be of floating type (in range [0, 1]), \"\n                f\"but found type {image.dtype} instead\"\n            )\n        mean = torch.tensor(self.image_mean, device=image.device)\n        std = torch.tensor(self.image_std, device=image.device)\n        return (image - mean[:, None, None]) / std[:, None, None]\n\n    # Other methods (resize, batch_images) would be defined here.\n```\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Device Compatibility:** The mean and standard deviation tensors are created on the same device as the input image to ensure compatibility and avoid unnecessary data transfers between devices.\n- **Channel-wise Normalization:** The normalization is applied per channel, which is typical for color images where each channel (e.g., RGB) may have different mean and standard deviation values.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the input image is properly normalized, which is crucial for the performance of models that rely on this preprocessing step.",
