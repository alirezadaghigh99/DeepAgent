    "result": "Let's implement the `train_agent` function as described. This function will manage the training loop for an agent interacting with an environment, logging progress, and evaluating performance. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef train_agent(agent, env, steps, outdir, checkpoint_freq=1000, max_episode_len=None, step_offset=0, evaluator=None, successful_score=None, step_hooks=None, eval_during_episode=False, logger=None):\n    # Initialize variables\n    episode_rewards = []\n    episode_idx = 0\n    episode_reward = 0\n    observation = env.reset()\n    t = step_offset\n\n    # Ensure output directory exists\n    os.makedirs(outdir, exist_ok=True)\n\n    # Training loop\n    while t < steps:\n        # Select action\n        action = agent.act(observation)\n        \n        # Step the environment\n        next_observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)\n        episode_reward += reward\n\n        # Update the agent\n        agent.observe(observation, action, reward, next_observation, done)\n        \n        # Call step hooks if any\n        if step_hooks:\n            for hook in step_hooks:\n                hook(env, agent, t)\n\n        # Move to the next observation\n        observation = next_observation\n        t += 1\n\n        # Handle episode endings\n        if done or (max_episode_len and t % max_episode_len == 0):\n            episode_rewards.append(episode_reward)\n            episode_idx += 1\n            if logger:\n                logger.info(f'Episode {episode_idx} finished with reward {episode_reward}')\n            observation = env.reset()\n            episode_reward = 0\n\n        # Checkpointing\n        if t % checkpoint_freq == 0:\n            agent.save(os.path.join(outdir, f'checkpoint_{t}.pth'))\n            if logger:\n                logger.info(f'Checkpoint saved at step {t}')\n\n        # Evaluation\n        if evaluator and (t % checkpoint_freq == 0 or eval_during_episode):\n            eval_stats = evaluator.evaluate(agent)\n            if logger:\n                logger.info(f'Evaluation at step {t}: {eval_stats}')\n            if successful_score and eval_stats['mean'] >= successful_score:\n                agent.save(os.path.join(outdir, f'success_{t}.pth'))\n                if logger:\n                    logger.info(f'Successful score reached at step {t}, model saved')\n                break\n\n    # Final save\n    agent.save(os.path.join(outdir, 'final_model.pth'))\n    if logger:\n        logger.info('Final model saved')\n\n    # Return evaluation statistics\n    return eval_stats if evaluator else []\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize variables to track episode rewards and indices. The environment is reset to get the initial observation.\n\n2. **Training Loop**: The loop runs until the specified number of steps is reached. In each iteration:\n   - The agent selects an action based on the current observation.\n   - The environment is stepped with the selected action, returning the next observation, reward, and done flag.\n   - The agent updates its internal state with the observed transition.\n   - Optional step hooks are called if provided.\n\n3. **Episode Handling**: If an episode ends (either naturally or due to a maximum length), the episode reward is logged, and the environment is reset.\n\n4. **Checkpointing**: The agent's state is periodically saved to disk.\n\n5. **Evaluation**: The agent is evaluated periodically, and if a successful score is achieved, the model is saved.\n\n6. **Final Save**: After training, the final model is saved.\n\n7. **Return**: The function returns evaluation statistics if an evaluator is provided.\n\nThis function is designed to be flexible, allowing for optional logging, evaluation, and step hooks, making it suitable for a variety of training scenarios.",
    "prompt": "Define a Python function called train_agent that takes in the following parameters: agent, env, steps, outdir, checkpoint_freq (optional), max_episode_len (optional), step_offset (default 0), evaluator (optional), successful_score (optional), step_hooks (optional), eval_during_episode (default False), and logger (optional). The function runs a training loop for the agent in the environment for a specified number of steps. It logs the progress and evaluates the agent's performance during training.\n\nThe function initializes variables for episode rewards and index, resets the environment, and iterates through steps while taking actions, observing outcomes, and updating the agent. It also handles episode endings, logging statistics, and evaluating the agent's performance. If a successful score is achieved or an exception occurs, the function saves the agent's model. Finally, it returns a list of evaluation statistics history.\n\nThe output of the function is a list of evaluation episode statistics dictionaries.",
