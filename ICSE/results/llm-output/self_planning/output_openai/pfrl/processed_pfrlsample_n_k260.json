    "result": "Here's the `sample_n_k` function implemented according to the plan you provided. This function efficiently samples `k` distinct elements from the range `0` to `n` based on the conditions specified:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef sample_n_k(n, k):\n    # Step 1: Input Validation\n    if k > n or k < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"k must be non-negative and less than or equal to n.\")\n    if k == 0:\n        return np.array([])\n\n    # Step 2: Sampling Strategy\n    if 3 * k >= n:\n        # Use random.choice to sample k elements without replacement\n        return np.random.choice(n, k, replace=False)\n    else:\n        # Sample 2 * k elements and ensure they are distinct\n        sampled_elements = set()\n        while len(sampled_elements) < k:\n            sampled_elements.update(np.random.choice(n, 2 * k, replace=False))\n        # Convert to list and return the first k elements\n        return np.array(list(sampled_elements)[:k])\n\n# Example usage:\n# sample_n_k(10, 3) might return an array like [2, 5, 7]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**:\n   - The function first checks if `k` is greater than `n` or if `k` is negative. If either condition is true, it raises a `ValueError`.\n   - If `k` is `0`, it returns an empty NumPy array immediately.\n\n2. **Sampling Strategy**:\n   - If `3 * k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function uses `np.random.choice` to sample `k` elements without replacement. This is efficient when `k` is a large portion of `n`.\n   - Otherwise, the function samples `2 * k` elements and ensures they are distinct by using a set. It continues sampling until it has at least `k` distinct elements.\n\n3. **Return the Result**:\n   - If using the `random.choice` method, the function returns the sampled elements directly.\n   - If using the `2 * k` sampling method, it converts the set to a list and returns the first `k` elements.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function is both efficient and correct for different values of `k` and `n`.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called sample_n_k that samples k distinct elements uniformly from the range 0 to n. The inputs are two integers, n and k. The function will raise a ValueError if k is larger than n or is negative. If k is 0, the function will return an empty NumPy array. If 3 times k is greater than or equal to n, the function will use NumPy's random.choice function to sample k elements without replacement. Otherwise, the function will sample 2k elements and ensure that they are distinct before returning the first k elements. The output of the function is a NumPy array containing k distinct elements sampled from the range 0 to n.",
