    "result": "Here's a detailed implementation of the `sample_based_on_detections_number` function, following the steps outlined in your plan. This function checks if a prediction meets certain criteria and returns a boolean value based on those criteria and a probability factor.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport random\n\ndef sample_based_on_detections_number(image, prediction, prediction_type, more_than=None, less_than=None, selected_class_names=set(), probability=1.0):\n    # Define eligible prediction types\n    eligible_types = {'type1', 'type2', 'type3'}  # Example types\n\n    # Step 1: Input Validation\n    # Check if prediction is a stub or type is not eligible\n    if prediction is None or prediction_type not in eligible_types:\n        return False\n\n    # Step 2: Count Detections\n    # Count detections close to the threshold\n    num_detections = count_detections_close_to_threshold(image, prediction, selected_class_names, probability)\n\n    # Step 3: Range Check\n    # Check if the number of detections falls within the specified range\n    if more_than is not None and num_detections <= more_than:\n        return False\n    if less_than is not None and num_detections >= less_than:\n        return False\n\n    # Step 4: Probability Check\n    # Return True with the specified probability\n    return random.random() < probability\n\ndef count_detections_close_to_threshold(image, prediction, selected_class_names, threshold):\n    # Placeholder function to count detections close to a threshold\n    # This function should be implemented based on specific requirements\n    return len([det for det in prediction if det['class'] in selected_class_names and det['probability'] >= threshold])\n\n# Example usage\n# Assuming `image` is a NumPy array, `prediction` is a list of detection dictionaries,\n# and `prediction_type` is a string representing the type of prediction.\nimage = np.array([])  # Placeholder for an actual image array\nprediction = [{'class': 'type1', 'probability': 0.9}, {'class': 'type2', 'probability': 0.8}]\nprediction_type = 'type1'\nselected_class_names = {'type1', 'type2'}\nprobability = 0.5\n\nresult = sample_based_on_detections_number(image, prediction, prediction_type, more_than=0, less_than=3, selected_class_names=selected_class_names, probability=probability)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Eligible Types**: The `eligible_types` set should be defined based on the specific types of predictions your application supports.\n- **Probability Handling**: The function uses `random.random()` to generate a random float between 0 and 1, and compares it to the `probability` parameter to decide whether to return `True`.\n- **Detection Counting**: The `count_detections_close_to_threshold` function is a placeholder and should be implemented to accurately count detections based on your application's requirements. It currently checks if the detection's class is in the `selected_class_names` and if its probability is above the threshold.\n\nThis implementation provides a flexible way to sample predictions based on detection counts and probability, allowing for customization based on your specific needs.",
    "prompt": "Define a Python function called sample_based_on_detections_number that takes in parameters including an image as a NumPy array, a prediction object, a prediction type, optional integer values for more_than and less_than, a set of selected class names, and a probability value. The function returns a boolean value.\n\nWithin the function, it first checks if the prediction is a stub or if the prediction type is not in a predefined list of eligible types, in which case it returns False. It then calculates the number of detections close to a threshold using the count_detections_close_to_threshold function with specific parameters. \n\nAfterwards, it checks if the calculated value falls within a specified range based on the more_than and less_than parameters. If it does, the function returns True with a probability determined by a random number generator. Otherwise, it returns False.",
