    "result": "The function `numpy_array_to_base64_jpeg` you've outlined is well-structured and effectively converts a NumPy array representing an image into a Base64-encoded JPEG string. Let's go through the implementation step-by-step to ensure clarity and correctness:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: The function imports `cv2` for image encoding and `base64` for converting the encoded image into a Base64 string. It also imports `numpy` to handle the image array.\n\n2. **Check Image Validity**: The function checks if the input is a valid NumPy array and verifies that its shape is compatible with OpenCV's image encoding requirements. This ensures that the function can handle both grayscale and color images.\n\n3. **Encode Image to JPEG**: The function uses `cv2.imencode` to encode the image into JPEG format. This step is crucial as it converts the image data into a format that can be easily transmitted or stored.\n\n4. **Convert to Base64**: The function uses `base64.b64encode` to convert the JPEG byte array into a Base64-encoded string. This encoding is useful for embedding images in text-based formats like JSON or HTML.\n\n5. **Return the Base64 String**: Finally, the function decodes the Base64 byte string into a regular string and returns it.\n\nHere's the complete implementation of the function:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nimport base64\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef numpy_array_to_base64_jpeg(image: np.ndarray) -> str:\n    # Check if the input is a valid NumPy array\n    if not isinstance(image, np.ndarray):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a NumPy array.\")\n    \n    # Check if the image shape is compatible with OpenCV encoding\n    if len(image.shape) not in [2, 3]:\n        raise ValueError(\"Image shape must be (H, W) for grayscale or (H, W, 3) for color images.\")\n    \n    # Encode the image to JPEG format\n    success, encoded_image = cv2.imencode('.jpg', image)\n    if not success:\n        raise ValueError(\"Image encoding failed.\")\n    \n    # Convert the encoded image to a Base64 string\n    base64_encoded_image = base64.b64encode(encoded_image).decode('utf-8')\n    \n    return base64_encoded_image\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Error Handling**: The function raises a `ValueError` if the input is not a valid NumPy array or if the image encoding fails. This helps in debugging and ensures that the function is used correctly.\n- **Flexibility**: The function can handle both grayscale and color images, making it versatile for different types of image data.\n- **Encoding and Decoding**: The use of `base64.b64encode` and `.decode('utf-8')` ensures that the output is a string, which is often required for data transmission or storage in text-based formats.\n\nThis function is a useful utility for applications that need to convert image data into a format suitable for embedding in web pages, sending over networks, or storing in databases.",
