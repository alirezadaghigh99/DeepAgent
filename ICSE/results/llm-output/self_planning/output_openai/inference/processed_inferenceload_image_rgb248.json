    "result": "To implement the `load_image_rgb` function as described, we need to ensure that the `load_image` function is available and correctly handles the input to return an image in a format that can be checked for its color channel order. Here's a complete implementation of the `load_image_rgb` function, including a mock implementation of `load_image` for demonstration purposes:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cv2  # OpenCV is commonly used for image processing\n\ndef load_image(value, disable_preproc_auto_orient=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Mock implementation of load_image function.\n    This function should load an image from the given value.\n    For demonstration, we'll assume value is a file path.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Load the image using OpenCV\n    image = cv2.imread(value, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)\n    \n    # If disable_preproc_auto_orient is True, we might skip some orientation correction\n    # For simplicity, this mock function does not handle orientation.\n    \n    if image is None:\n        raise ValueError(\"Image could not be loaded. Please check the file path or input value.\")\n    \n    return image\n\ndef load_image_rgb(value, disable_preproc_auto_orient=False):\n    # Step 2: Load the image using the load_image function\n    image = load_image(value, disable_preproc_auto_orient=disable_preproc_auto_orient)\n    \n    # Step 3: Determine if the image is in BGR format\n    # OpenCV loads images in BGR format by default\n    if image.shape[-1] == 3:  # Assuming the last dimension is the color channel\n        # Step 4: Convert BGR to RGB\n        image_rgb = image[..., ::-1]  # Reverse the order of the last dimension\n    else:\n        image_rgb = image  # If not BGR, assume it's already RGB\n    \n    # Step 5: Return the image in RGB format\n    return image_rgb\n\n# Example usage:\n# Assuming 'example.jpg' is a valid image file path\ntry:\n    rgb_image = load_image_rgb('example.jpg')\n    print(\"Image loaded and converted to RGB format successfully.\")\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **OpenCV**: The `cv2.imread` function from OpenCV is used to load images. By default, it loads images in BGR format.\n- **Error Handling**: The `load_image` function raises a `ValueError` if the image cannot be loaded, which is caught in the example usage.\n- **Channel Order**: The conversion from BGR to RGB is done using NumPy slicing (`image[..., ::-1]`), which efficiently reverses the order of the color channels.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input `value` is a file path to an image. In a real-world scenario, `load_image` should be more robust and handle different types of input, such as URLs or image data in memory.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called load_image_rgb that takes in a value of any type and a boolean disable_preproc_auto_orient as input. The function returns a NumPy array representing the loaded image in RGB format. The function internally calls another function load_image to load the image and determine if it is in BGR format. If the image is in BGR format, it converts it to RGB. The output of the function is the loaded image in RGB format.",
