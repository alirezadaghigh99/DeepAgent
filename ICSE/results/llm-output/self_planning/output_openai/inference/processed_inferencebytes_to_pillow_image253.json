    "result": "Here's the complete implementation of the `bytes_to_pillow_image` function, following the steps outlined in your plan:\n\n```python\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom PIL import Image, UnidentifiedImageError\n\n# Define a custom exception for encoding errors\nclass EncodingError(Exception):\n    pass\n\ndef bytes_to_pillow_image(payload):\n    try:\n        # Convert bytes to a file-like object\n        image_stream = BytesIO(payload)\n        \n        # Attempt to open the image\n        image = Image.open(image_stream)\n        \n        # Return the Pillow Image object\n        return image\n    \n    except (IOError, UnidentifiedImageError):\n        # Raise a custom error if the image format is not recognized\n        raise EncodingError(\"Could not encode bytes to PIL image.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Imports**:\n   - `BytesIO` is imported from the `io` module to handle the bytes data as a file-like object.\n   - `Image` and `UnidentifiedImageError` are imported from the `PIL` (Pillow) library. `UnidentifiedImageError` is used to catch errors when the image format is not recognized.\n\n2. **Custom Exception**:\n   - `EncodingError` is defined as a custom exception to provide a specific error message when the image cannot be encoded.\n\n3. **Function Implementation**:\n   - The function `bytes_to_pillow_image` takes a `payload` parameter, which is expected to be a bytes object.\n   - It uses `BytesIO` to wrap the `payload`, allowing it to be treated as a file-like object.\n   - `Image.open` attempts to open this file-like object as an image. If successful, it returns the Pillow Image object.\n   - If the image format is not recognized, an `IOError` or `UnidentifiedImageError` is raised, which is caught and re-raised as a custom `EncodingError` with a descriptive message.\n\nThis function is designed to handle the conversion of bytes data to a Pillow Image object robustly, with appropriate error handling for unrecognized image formats.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called bytes_to_pillow_image that takes a bytes object called payload as input and returns a Pillow Image object. The function reads the bytes data using BytesIO, attempts to open it as an image using Image.open, and raises an EncodingError with the message \"Could not encode bytes to PIL image.\" if the image format is not recognized.",
