A real implementation would require a more sophisticated approach to handle these tasks efficiently.\n\n3. **Main `cubify` Function:**\n   - The function iterates over each voxel grid, generates cubes for occupied voxels, and collects the vertices and faces.\n   - The vertices and faces are then used to create a `Meshes` object, which is returned as the output.\n\nThis implementation provides a basic framework for converting voxel grids into meshes. The `merge_and_clean` function is simplified and would need a more detailed implementation for practical use, especially for large voxel grids.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called cubify that takes in the following parameters:\n- voxels: a torch.Tensor of shape (N, D, H, W) containing occupancy probabilities\n- thresh: a scalar threshold\n- feats: an optional torch.Tensor of shape (N, K, D, H, W) containing color information\n- device: the device of the output meshes\n- align: a string defining the alignment of the mesh vertices and grid locations\n\nThe function converts a voxel to a mesh by replacing each occupied voxel with a cube consisting of 12 faces and 8 vertices. Shared vertices are merged, and internal faces are removed. The alignment between the vertices of the cubified mesh and the voxel locations is defined by the choice of align, which can be \"topleft\", \"corner\", or \"center\".\n\nThe function returns a Meshes object of the corresponding meshes.",
