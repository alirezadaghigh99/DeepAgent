    "result": "To implement the `mesh_edge_loss` function as described, we need to ensure that we handle the computation of edge lengths, weights, and the final loss correctly. Here's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef mesh_edge_loss(meshes, target_length):\n    # Check if the meshes object is empty\n    if len(meshes) == 0:\n        return torch.tensor(0.0)\n\n    total_loss = 0.0\n    num_meshes = len(meshes)\n\n    for mesh in meshes:\n        # Extract vertices and edges\n        vertices = mesh.verts_packed()\n        edges = mesh.edges_packed()\n\n        # Compute edge lengths\n        edge_lengths = torch.norm(vertices[edges[:, 0]] - vertices[edges[:, 1]], dim=1)\n\n        # Calculate edge weights\n        num_edges = len(edges)\n        edge_weights = 1.0 / num_edges\n\n        # Compute loss for the current mesh\n        loss = torch.sum(edge_weights * (edge_lengths - target_length) ** 2)\n        total_loss += loss\n\n    # Average the loss across the batch\n    average_loss = total_loss / num_meshes\n\n    return average_loss\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n1. **Check for Empty Meshes**:\n   - We first check if the `meshes` object is empty. If it is, we return a tensor with a value of 0.0.\n\n2. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - We initialize `total_loss` to accumulate the loss across all meshes.\n   - `num_meshes` is determined to know how many meshes are in the batch.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Each Mesh**:\n   - We loop through each mesh in the batch to compute the loss for each one.\n\n4. **Compute Edge Lengths**:\n   - For each mesh, we extract the vertices and edges.\n   - We compute the length of each edge using the Euclidean distance formula.\n\n5. **Calculate Edge Weights**:\n   - We determine the number of edges in the current mesh.\n   - The weight for each edge is computed as the inverse of the number of edges, ensuring equal contribution from each mesh.\n\n6. **Compute Loss for Each Mesh**:\n   - We calculate the squared difference between each edge length and the `target_length`.\n   - We multiply these squared differences by the edge weights and sum them to get the loss for the current mesh.\n\n7. **Average the Loss Across the Batch**:\n   - We divide the accumulated total loss by the number of meshes to get the average loss.\n\n8. **Return the Final Loss**:\n   - Finally, we return the computed average loss as a tensor.\n\nThis function ensures that each mesh contributes equally to the final loss, regardless of the number of edges it contains, by weighting the loss inversely by the number of edges.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called mesh_edge_loss that computes the mesh edge length regularization loss averaged across all meshes in a batch. The function takes in two arguments: meshes (a Meshes object with a batch of meshes) and target_length (a float representing the resting value for the edge length). \n\nThe function calculates the average loss across the batch, where each mesh contributes equally to the final loss, regardless of the number of edges per mesh. Each mesh is weighted with the inverse number of edges, so that meshes with fewer edges have a higher impact on the final loss.\n\nIf the input meshes object is empty, the function returns a tensor with a value of 0.0. Otherwise, the function computes the loss by determining the weight for each edge based on the number of edges in the corresponding mesh. The loss is calculated as the squared difference between the edge length and the target length, multiplied by the weights. \n\nFinally, the function returns the sum of the weighted losses divided by the total number of meshes in the batch.",
