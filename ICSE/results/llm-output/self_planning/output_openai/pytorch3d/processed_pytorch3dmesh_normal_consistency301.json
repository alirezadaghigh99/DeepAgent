    "result": "The function `mesh_normal_consistency` is designed to compute the average normal consistency of a batch of meshes. Here's a breakdown of how the function works, along with the implementation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the input `Meshes` object contains any meshes. If there are no meshes or all meshes are empty, it returns 0 immediately.\n\n2. **Extract Mesh Data**: For each mesh in the batch, the function extracts the vertices and faces. This data is necessary to compute face normals and identify neighboring faces.\n\n3. **Compute Face Normals**: The function calculates the normal vector for each face in the mesh using the cross product of two edges of the face. The normals are then normalized.\n\n4. **Identify Neighboring Faces**: The function maps edges to faces using a dictionary. For each face, it iterates over its edges and stores the face indices in the dictionary, allowing efficient lookup of neighboring faces.\n\n5. **Calculate Normal Consistency**: For each pair of neighboring faces, the function computes the angle between their normals using the dot product. It accumulates these values to compute the average normal consistency for the mesh.\n\n6. **Aggregate Results**: The function computes the average normal consistency across all meshes in the batch by summing the normal consistency values for each mesh and dividing by the number of valid meshes.\n\n7. **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns the computed average normal consistency. If there were no valid meshes to process, it returns 0.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `mesh_normal_consistency` function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef mesh_normal_consistency(meshes):\n    if len(meshes) == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    total_consistency = 0\n    valid_mesh_count = 0\n\n    for mesh in meshes:\n        vertices = mesh.verts_packed()\n        faces = mesh.faces_packed()\n\n        if faces.size(0) == 0:\n            continue\n\n        # Compute face normals\n        v0 = vertices[faces[:, 0]]\n        v1 = vertices[faces[:, 1]]\n        v2 = vertices[faces[:, 2]]\n        face_normals = torch.cross(v1 - v0, v2 - v0, dim=1)\n        face_normals = face_normals / face_normals.norm(dim=1, keepdim=True)\n\n        # Map edges to faces\n        edge_to_faces = {}\n        for i, face in enumerate(faces):\n            edges = [(face[0], face[1]), (face[1], face[2]), (face[2], face[0])]\n            for edge in edges:\n                edge = tuple(sorted(edge))\n                if edge not in edge_to_faces:\n                    edge_to_faces[edge] = []\n                edge_to_faces[edge].append(i)\n\n        # Calculate normal consistency\n        consistency_sum = 0\n        edge_count = 0\n        for edge, face_indices in edge_to_faces.items():\n            if len(face_indices) < 2:\n                continue\n            for i in range(len(face_indices) - 1):\n                for j in range(i + 1, len(face_indices)):\n                    f1, f2 = face_indices[i], face_indices[j]\n                    normal1, normal2 = face_normals[f1], face_normals[f2]\n                    cos_angle = torch.dot(normal1, normal2)\n                    consistency_sum += cos_angle\n                    edge_count += 1\n\n        if edge_count > 0:\n            mesh_consistency = consistency_sum / edge_count\n            total_consistency += mesh_consistency\n            valid_mesh_count += 1\n\n    if valid_mesh_count == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    return total_consistency / valid_mesh_count\n```\n\nThis function efficiently computes the normal consistency for each mesh in the batch and handles cases where there are no valid meshes to process.

    "prompt": "Define a Python function called mesh_normal_consistency that computes the normal consistency of each mesh in a batch of meshes. The function takes a Meshes object as input and returns the average normal consistency across the batch. If the input meshes contain no meshes or all empty meshes, the function returns 0. The normal consistency is calculated based on the angles between the normals of neighboring faces in the meshes. The function handles cases where multiple faces share an edge and efficiently finds the vertices associated with each edge.",
