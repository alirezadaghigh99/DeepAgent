    "result": "To implement the `inverse` method for the `Transform3d` class, we need to handle two scenarios based on the `invert_composed` parameter. Here's a detailed implementation of the method:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: str = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        # Initialize the transformation matrix to identity if not provided\n        self._matrix = matrix if matrix is not None else torch.eye(4, dtype=dtype, device=device)\n        self._transforms = []  # List to store individual transformations\n        self.device = device\n        self.dtype = dtype\n\n    def inverse(self, invert_composed: bool = False) -> \"Transform3d\":\n        if invert_composed:\n            # Compose all transformations into a single matrix\n            composed_matrix = self._matrix.clone()\n            for transform in self._transforms:\n                composed_matrix = composed_matrix @ transform\n            # Invert the composed matrix\n            inverse_matrix = torch.linalg.inv(composed_matrix)\n            # Return a new Transform3d object with the inverted matrix\n            return Transform3d(dtype=self.dtype, device=self.device, matrix=inverse_matrix)\n        else:\n            # Invert each transformation individually\n            inverse_transforms = [torch.linalg.inv(transform) for transform in reversed(self._transforms)]\n            inverse_matrix = torch.linalg.inv(self._matrix)\n            # Create a new Transform3d object with the inverses\n            new_transform = Transform3d(dtype=self.dtype, device=self.device, matrix=inverse_matrix)\n            new_transform._transforms = inverse_transforms\n            return new_transform\n\n# Example usage:\n# transform = Transform3d()\n# inverse_transform = transform.inverse(invert_composed=True)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - The `__init__` method initializes the transformation matrix to an identity matrix if no matrix is provided. It also initializes an empty list `_transforms` to store individual transformations.\n\n2. **Inverse Method**:\n   - **`invert_composed=True`**:\n     - Compose all transformations into a single matrix by multiplying them in sequence.\n     - Use `torch.linalg.inv` to compute the inverse of the composed matrix.\n     - Return a new `Transform3d` object initialized with this inverse matrix.\n   \n   - **`invert_composed=False`**:\n     - Invert each transformation in the `_transforms` list individually. The transformations are reversed to maintain the correct order of application when inverted.\n     - Compute the inverse of the initial matrix `_matrix`.\n     - Create a new `Transform3d` object with the inverted matrix and the list of inverted transformations.\n\nThis implementation efficiently handles both scenarios, ensuring that the inverse transformation is correctly computed and returned as a new `Transform3d` object.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `inverse` for the `Transform3d` class that returns a new `Transform3d` object representing the inverse of the current transformation. The method should have an argument `invert_composed` which, when set to `True`, first composes the list of stored transformations and then inverts the result, and when set to `False`, inverts the individual stored transformations independently without composing them. The method should efficiently handle both cases, returning a new `Transform3d` object containing the inverse of the original transformation.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: Device = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self._matrix = ...\n        self._transforms = []\n        self.device = ...\n        self.dtype = ...\n\n    def inverse(self, invert_composed: bool = False) -> \"Transform3d\":\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
