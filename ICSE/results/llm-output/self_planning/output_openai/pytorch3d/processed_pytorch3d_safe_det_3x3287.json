    "result": "Here's the implementation of the `_safe_det_3x3` function following the steps you outlined. This function manually computes the determinant of each 3x3 matrix in a batch using the standard formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. Let's go through the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _safe_det_3x3(t: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    # Step 1: Input Validation\n    if t.ndim != 3 or t.shape[1:] != (3, 3):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input tensor must have shape (N, 3, 3)\")\n\n    # Step 2: Extract Matrix Elements\n    a11, a12, a13 = t[:, 0, 0], t[:, 0, 1], t[:, 0, 2]\n    a21, a22, a23 = t[:, 1, 0], t[:, 1, 1], t[:, 1, 2]\n    a31, a32, a33 = t[:, 2, 0], t[:, 2, 1], t[:, 2, 2]\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate Determinant\n    det = (a11 * (a22 * a33 - a23 * a32) -\n           a12 * (a21 * a33 - a23 * a31) +\n           a13 * (a21 * a32 - a22 * a31))\n\n    # Step 4: Return Results\n    return det\n\n# Example usage:\n# Create a batch of 5 random 3x3 matrices\nt = torch.randn(5, 3, 3)\n# Calculate determinants\ndeterminants = _safe_det_3x3(t)\nprint(determinants)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the input tensor `t` has three dimensions and that the last two dimensions are 3x3. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Extract Matrix Elements**: The elements of each 3x3 matrix are extracted using tensor slicing. This allows us to compute the determinant for each matrix in the batch simultaneously.\n\n3. **Calculate Determinant**: The determinant is calculated using the formula for a 3x3 matrix. This is done in a vectorized manner, which is efficient for batch processing.\n\n4. **Return Results**: The function returns a tensor containing the determinants of each matrix in the batch.\n\nThis implementation is efficient and leverages PyTorch's ability to handle operations on batches of data, making it suitable for scenarios where you need to compute determinants for multiple matrices at once.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called _safe_det_3x3 that calculates the determinant of a batch of 3x3 matrices. The input is a torch.Tensor t of shape (N, 3, 3) where N is the number of matrices in the batch. The function returns a torch.Tensor of shape (N) containing the determinants of the input matrices. Note that the result of this function may differ slightly from the torch.det() function, with potential differences in the last significant digit.",
