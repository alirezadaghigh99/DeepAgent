If the points are in 2D format (P, 3), it adds a batch dimension to make them compatible with the transformation process.\n\n2. **Homogeneous Coordinates**:\n   - The points are converted to homogeneous coordinates by appending a column of ones. This allows the transformation matrix to include translation components.\n\n3. **Transformation Application**:\n   - The transformation matrix is applied using batched matrix multiplication (`torch.bmm`). The transformation matrix is transposed to align with the point vectors for multiplication.\n\n4. **Homogeneous Coordinate Handling**:\n   - The homogeneous coordinate (fourth dimension) is extracted. If `eps` is provided, it clamps the values to avoid division by zero, ensuring numerical stability.\n\n5. **Conversion Back to 3D**:\n   - The transformed points are converted back to 3D by dividing by the homogeneous coordinate.\n\n6. **Output Format**:\n   - If the input was originally in 2D format, the batch dimension is removed before returning the result.\n\nThis implementation is efficient and flexible, handling both 2D and 3D input formats and ensuring stability with the optional `eps` parameter.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `transform_points` for the `Transform3d` class that transforms a set of 3D points using the transformation matrix. The method should handle points in either 2D (P, 3) or 3D (N, P, 3) format, where P is the number of points and N is the batch size. It should perform a homogeneous transformation, adding a fourth coordinate to the points, applying the transformation matrix using batched matrix multiplication, and then dividing by the homogeneous coordinate. If an optional `eps` argument is provided, it should clamp the homogeneous coordinate to avoid division by zero.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: Device = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self._matrix = ...\n        self._transforms = []\n        self.device = ...\n        self.dtype = ...\n\n    def transform_points(self, points, eps: Optional[float] = None) -> torch.Tensor:\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
