    "result": "Let's implement the function `_get_splat_kernel_normalization` as described in your request. This function will validate the `sigma` value, compute a normalization constant using the `offsets` tensor, and return a normalized value. Here's how you can implement it in Python:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _get_splat_kernel_normalization(offsets, sigma=0.5):\n    # Step 1: Validate Sigma\n    if sigma <= 0.0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Sigma must be greater than 0.0\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate Normalization Constant\n    # Compute the squared values of the offsets\n    squared_offsets = offsets ** 2\n    # Sum the squared values\n    sum_squared_offsets = torch.sum(squared_offsets, dim=-1)\n    # Compute the exponential of the negative sum divided by (2 * sigma^2)\n    normalization_constant = torch.exp(-sum_squared_offsets / (2 * sigma ** 2))\n\n    # Step 3: Add Epsilon\n    epsilon = 0.05\n    normalization_constant += epsilon\n\n    # Step 4: Return Normalized Value\n    normalized_value = (1 + epsilon) / normalization_constant\n    return normalized_value\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Validate Sigma**: The function first checks if `sigma` is less than or equal to 0.0 and raises a `ValueError` if it is. This ensures that the function operates with a valid `sigma` value.\n\n2. **Calculate Normalization Constant**:\n   - The `offsets` tensor is squared element-wise.\n   - The squared values are summed along the last dimension.\n   - The exponential of the negative sum divided by `2 * sigma^2` is computed to get the normalization constant.\n\n3. **Add Epsilon**: An epsilon value of 0.05 is added to the normalization constant to ensure gradient flow through non-boundary pixels.\n\n4. **Return Normalized Value**: The function returns the normalized value by dividing `(1 + epsilon)` by the normalization constant.\n\nThis function assumes that `offsets` is a PyTorch tensor, which is common in deep learning frameworks. If you are using a different tensor library, you may need to adjust the syntax accordingly.",
    "prompt": "Define a Python function called `_get_splat_kernel_normalization` that takes in a tensor `offsets` and a float `sigma` with a default value of 0.5. If the `sigma` value is less than or equal to 0.0, a ValueError is raised. The function calculates a normalization constant using the formula involving exponential and sum operations on the squared values of the `offsets` tensor. An epsilon value of 0.05 is added to the normalization constant to ensure gradient flow through non-boundary pixels. The function returns a normalized value by dividing (1 + epsilon) by the normalization constant.",
