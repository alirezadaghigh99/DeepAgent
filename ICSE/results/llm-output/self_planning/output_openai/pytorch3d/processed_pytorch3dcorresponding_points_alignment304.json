If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n   - If `weights` are not provided, it defaults to uniform weights (all ones).\n   - It also checks if the `weights` have the correct shape, matching the first two dimensions of `X`.\n\n2. **Compute Centroids**:\n   - The centroids of `X` and `Y` are computed using the provided weights. This is done by taking a weighted sum of the points and dividing by the sum of the weights.\n\n3. **Center the Points**:\n   - The centroids are subtracted from the respective point sets to center them around the origin.\n\n4. **Compute Covariance Matrix**:\n   - The covariance matrix is calculated using the centered points and the weights.\n\n5. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**:\n   - SVD is performed on the covariance matrix to obtain matrices `U`, `S`, and `Vt`.\n\n6. **Compute Rotation Matrix `R`**:\n   - The rotation matrix `R` is computed using `U` and `Vt`. If `allow_reflection` is `False`, the function ensures that the determinant of `R` is +1 to avoid reflection.\n\n7. **Compute Scale `s` (if `estimate_scale` is True)**:\n   - If `estimate_scale` is `True`, the scale factor `s` is computed using the singular values `S` and the variance of `X`.\n   - If `estimate_scale` is `False`, `s` is set to 1.\n\n8. **Compute Translation `T`**:\n   - The translation vector `T` is calculated using the centroids of `X` and `Y`, the rotation matrix `R`, and the scale `s`.\n\n9. **Return the Transformation**:\n   - The function returns a named tuple `SimilarityTransform` containing the rotation matrix `R`, translation vector `T`, and scale `s`.\n\nThis implementation provides a robust method for aligning two sets of points using a similarity transformation, which includes rotation, translation, and optional scaling.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called corresponding_points_alignment that Finds a similarity transformation (rotation `R`, translation `T`\n    and optionally scale `s`)  between two given sets of corresponding\n    `d`-dimensional points `X` and `Y` such that:\n\n    `s[i] X[i] R[i] + T[i] = Y[i]`,\n\n    for all batch indexes `i` in the least squares sense.\n\n    The algorithm is also known as Umeyama [1].\n\n    Args:\n        **X**: Batch of `d`-dimensional points of shape `(minibatch, num_point, d)`\n            or a `Pointclouds` object.\n        **Y**: Batch of `d`-dimensional points of shape `(minibatch, num_point, d)`\n            or a `Pointclouds` object.\n        **weights**: Batch of non-negative weights of\n            shape `(minibatch, num_point)` or list of `minibatch` 1-dimensional\n            tensors that may have different shapes; in that case, the length of\n            i-th tensor should be equal to the number of points in X_i and Y_i.\n            Passing `None` means uniform weights.\n        **estimate_scale**: If `True`, also estimates a scaling component `s`\n            of the transformation.
