    "result": "The provided implementation of the `so3_exp_map` function is a well-structured approach to converting a batch of logarithmic representations of rotation matrices into actual rotation matrices using Rodrigues' rotation formula. Let's go through the key components of the function and ensure everything is clear and correct:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function checks if the input tensor `log_rot` is a 2D tensor with the second dimension of size 3. This ensures that each vector in the batch represents a 3D rotation.\n\n2. **Norm Calculation**: The norm of each vector is calculated to determine the rotation angle. This is done using `torch.norm`, which computes the Euclidean norm.\n\n3. **Handling Singularity**: The norm is clamped using the `eps` parameter to avoid numerical instability when the norm is very small. This is crucial for ensuring that the division by the norm does not lead to undefined behavior.\n\n4. **Rodrigues' Formula**: The function constructs the skew-symmetric matrix `K` for each vector, which is a key component of Rodrigues' rotation formula. The rotation matrix `R` is then computed using trigonometric functions (`sin` and `cos`) applied to the clamped norm.\n\n5. **Output**: The function returns a batch of 3x3 rotation matrices, which are the result of applying Rodrigues' formula to each vector in the input batch.\n\nHere's the complete implementation of the function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef so3_exp_map(log_rot: torch.Tensor, eps: float = 0.0001) -> torch.Tensor:\n    # Validate input shape\n    if log_rot.ndim != 2 or log_rot.shape[1] != 3:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input log_rot must have shape (minibatch, 3)\")\n\n    # Compute the norm of each vector (angle of rotation)\n    theta = torch.norm(log_rot, dim=1, keepdim=True)\n\n    # Handle singularity by clamping the norm\n    theta_clamped = torch.clamp(theta, min=eps)\n\n    # Compute the unit rotation axis\n    k = log_rot / theta_clamped\n\n    # Compute the skew-symmetric matrix for each vector\n    K = torch.zeros((log_rot.shape[0], 3, 3), device=log_rot.device)\n    K[:, 0, 1] = -k[:, 2]\n    K[:, 0, 2] = k[:, 1]\n    K[:, 1, 0] = k[:, 2]\n    K[:, 1, 2] = -k[:, 0]\n    K[:, 2, 0] = -k[:, 1]\n    K[:, 2, 1] = k[:, 0]\n\n    # Compute the rotation matrices using Rodrigues' formula\n    I = torch.eye(3, device=log_rot.device).unsqueeze(0)\n    R = I + torch.sin(theta_clamped).unsqueeze(-1) * K + (1 - torch.cos(theta_clamped).unsqueeze(-1)) * torch.bmm(K, K)\n\n    return R\n\n# Example usage:\n# log_rot = torch.tensor([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]])\n# rotation_matrices = so3_exp_map(log_rot)\n# print(rotation_matrices)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Numerical Stability**: Clamping the norm ensures that the function remains stable even when the input vectors are very close to zero.\n- **Batch Processing**: The function is designed to handle a batch of input vectors, making it efficient for processing multiple rotations simultaneously.\n- **Rodrigues' Formula**: This formula is a standard method for converting axis-angle representations to rotation matrices, and the implementation here follows it accurately.\n\nThis function should work effectively for converting batches of logarithmic rotation representations into rotation matrices, handling edge cases with small angles gracefully.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called so3_exp_map that takes in a torch.Tensor log_rot representing a batch of logarithmic representations of rotation matrices and an optional float eps set to 0.0001. The function converts the logarithmic representations to a batch of 3x3 rotation matrices using the Rodrigues formula. The input log_rot should be a batch of vectors of shape (minibatch, 3) and the output should be a batch of rotation matrices of shape (minibatch, 3, 3). The function handles a singularity around log(R) = 0 by clamping it with the eps argument. If the input log_rot is of incorrect shape, a ValueError is raised. The function returns the batch of rotation matrices after conversion. Reference to Rodrigues' rotation formula is provided for further information.",
