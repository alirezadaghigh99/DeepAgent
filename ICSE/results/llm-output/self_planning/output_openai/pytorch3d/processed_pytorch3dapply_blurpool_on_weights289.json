    "result": "Here's a detailed implementation of the `apply_blurpool_on_weights` function, which processes a tensor of weights by applying a 2-tap max filter followed by a 2-tap blur filter. This function is designed to handle tensors of shape `(..., dim)`, where `dim` is the dimension along which the operations are applied. The function uses PyTorch for tensor operations:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef apply_blurpool_on_weights(weights):\n    # Step 1: Pad the weights tensor\n    # We pad the last dimension (dim) with 1 on each side to handle edge cases\n    # 'replicate' mode is used to replicate the edge values\n    padded_weights = F.pad(weights, (1, 1), mode='replicate')\n\n    # Step 2: Apply 2-tap max filter (max pooling)\n    # We use max_pool1d with kernel_size=2 and stride=1 to get the max over each pair\n    max_pooled_weights = F.max_pool1d(padded_weights.unsqueeze(-2), kernel_size=2, stride=1).squeeze(-2)\n\n    # Step 3: Apply 2-tap blur filter (average pooling)\n    # We use avg_pool1d with kernel_size=2 and stride=1 to average each pair\n    blurred_weights = F.avg_pool1d(max_pooled_weights.unsqueeze(-2), kernel_size=2, stride=1).squeeze(-2)\n\n    # Step 4: Linear interpolation is not explicitly needed here as the blur filter smooths the values\n    # The blur operation itself provides a smooth transition between values\n\n    # Step 5: Return the blurred weights\n    return blurred_weights\n\n# Example usage\nweights = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]])\nblurred_weights = apply_blurpool_on_weights(weights)\nprint(blurred_weights)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Padding**: The `weights` tensor is padded along the last dimension to ensure that the max pooling and blur operations can be applied without losing data at the edges. The `replicate` mode is used to replicate the edge values, which helps in maintaining the boundary values during pooling.\n\n2. **Max Pooling**: A 2-tap max filter is applied using `max_pool1d` with a kernel size of 2 and a stride of 1. This operation slides a window of size 2 across the padded weights and takes the maximum value within each window.\n\n3. **Blur Filter**: A 2-tap blur filter is applied using `avg_pool1d` with a kernel size of 2 and a stride of 1. This operation averages adjacent values, smoothing out the envelope created by the max pooling.\n\n4. **Linear Interpolation**: In this implementation, explicit linear interpolation is not necessary because the blur filter already provides a smooth transition between values.\n\n5. **Output**: The function returns the processed tensor `blurred_weights`, which has the same shape as the input `weights`.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input tensor is at least 2D. If the input tensor has more dimensions, the operations are applied along the last dimension (`dim`). Adjustments may be needed if the input tensor has a different structure.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called apply_blurpool_on_weights that filters weights with a 2-tap max filter followed by a 2-tap blur filter, producing a wide and smooth upper envelope on the weights. The input is a tensor called weights of shape `(..., dim)` and the output is a tensor called blured_weights of the same shape `(..., dim)`. The function pads the weights, applies max pooling, and then performs linear interpolation to create the blurred weights.",
