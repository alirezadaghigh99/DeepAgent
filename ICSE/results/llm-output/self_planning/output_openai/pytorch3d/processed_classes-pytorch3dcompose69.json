    "result": "The `compose` method for the `Transform3d` class is designed to combine multiple transformation matrices into a single transformation. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the method is implemented:\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Validate Input**: Ensure that all arguments passed to the `compose` method are instances of `Transform3d`. If any argument is not a `Transform3d` instance, a `TypeError` is raised. This ensures that only valid transformations are composed.\n\n2. **Initialize a New Transform**: A new `Transform3d` instance is created to represent the composed transformation. This instance starts with a copy of the current transformation matrix of the calling object. Cloning the matrix ensures that the original matrix remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Combine Transformations**: Iterate over each `Transform3d` object provided as an argument. For each one, multiply its transformation matrix with the current matrix of the new `Transform3d` instance. This multiplication is done using the `@` operator, which is the matrix multiplication operator in PyTorch.\n\n4. **Update Internal Transform List**: Append each of the provided `Transform3d` objects to the `_transforms` list of the new `Transform3d` instance. This list keeps track of all transformations that have been composed, which can be useful for debugging or further operations.\n\n5. **Return the Composed Transform**: Finally, return the new `Transform3d` instance that represents the combined transformation.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: str = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self.device = device\n        self.dtype = dtype\n        self._matrix = matrix if matrix is not None else torch.eye(4, dtype=dtype, device=device)\n        self._transforms = []\n\n    def compose(self, *others: \"Transform3d\") -> \"Transform3d\":\n        # Validate that all arguments are instances of Transform3d\n        for other in others:\n            if not isinstance(other, Transform3d):\n                raise TypeError(\"All arguments must be instances of Transform3d\")\n\n        # Create a new Transform3d instance for the composed transformation\n        composed_transform = Transform3d(dtype=self.dtype, device=self.device, matrix=self._matrix.clone())\n\n        # Combine the transformations\n        for other in others:\n            composed_transform._matrix = composed_transform._matrix @ other._matrix\n            composed_transform._transforms.append(other)\n\n        # Return the composed Transform3d\n        return composed_transform\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Matrix Multiplication**: The `@` operator is used for matrix multiplication, which is essential for combining transformation matrices.\n- **Cloning the Matrix**: The `clone()` method is used to create a copy of the matrix, ensuring that the original matrix is not altered during the composition.\n- **Tracking Transformations**: The `_transforms` list is updated to include all transformations that have been composed, providing a history of transformations applied.\n\nThis method is particularly useful in graphics and simulation applications where multiple transformations need to be applied sequentially to objects in a 3D space.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `compose` for the `Transform3d` class that combines the current transform with any number of other `Transform3d` objects passed as arguments. The method should return a new `Transform3d` instance representing the composed transformation, which combines the internal transformation matrix of the current instance with those of the provided transforms. Ensure that the internal list of transformations (`self._transforms`) is updated accordingly. The method should also verify that all provided arguments are instances of `Transform3d`.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: Device = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self._matrix = ...\n        self._transforms = []\n        self.device = ...\n        self.dtype = ...\n\n    def compose(self, *others: \"Transform3d\") -> \"Transform3d\":\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
