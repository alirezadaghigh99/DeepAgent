    "result": "To implement the `d2_log_loss_score` function, we need to calculate the D\u00b2 score, which is the fraction of log loss explained by the model. The D\u00b2 score is analogous to the R\u00b2 score used in regression, but it is adapted for classification tasks using log loss.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how to implement this function:\n\n1. **Check Number of Samples**: If the number of samples is less than two, return NaN and issue a warning, as the D\u00b2 score is not well-defined in this case.\n\n2. **Calculate Log Loss**: Use the `log_loss` function from `sklearn.metrics` to compute the log loss of the predictions.\n\n3. **Calculate Baseline Log Loss**: Compute the log loss of a baseline model that always predicts the class distribution of `y_true`. This serves as a reference point.\n\n4. **Calculate D\u00b2 Score**: The D\u00b2 score is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   D^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\text{Log Loss of Model}}{\\text{Log Loss of Baseline}}\n   \\]\n   This formula measures the improvement of the model over the baseline.\n\n5. **Return D\u00b2 Score**: Return the computed D\u00b2 score.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `d2_log_loss_score` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics import log_loss\nimport warnings\nfrom sklearn.utils.validation import _num_samples\nfrom sklearn.exceptions import UndefinedMetricWarning\n\ndef d2_log_loss_score(y_true, y_pred, sample_weight=None, labels=None):\n    if _num_samples(y_pred) < 2:\n        msg = \"D^2 score is not well-defined with less than two samples.\"\n        warnings.warn(msg, UndefinedMetricWarning)\n        return float(\"nan\")\n\n    # Calculate log loss of the model\n    model_log_loss = log_loss(y_true, y_pred, sample_weight=sample_weight, labels=labels)\n\n    # Calculate the baseline log loss\n    if labels is None:\n        labels = np.unique(y_true)\n    \n    # Calculate class probabilities from y_true\n    class_counts = np.bincount(y_true, minlength=len(labels))\n    class_probs = class_counts / class_counts.sum()\n    \n    # Create a baseline prediction array\n    baseline_pred = np.tile(class_probs, (len(y_true), 1))\n    \n    # Calculate log loss of the baseline model\n    baseline_log_loss = log_loss(y_true, baseline_pred, sample_weight=sample_weight, labels=labels)\n\n    # Calculate D^2 score\n    d2_score = 1 - (model_log_loss / baseline_log_loss)\n\n    return d2_score\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Log Loss Calculation**: The `log_loss` function computes the negative log likelihood of the true labels given the predicted probabilities.\n- **Baseline Model**: The baseline model predicts the class distribution of `y_true` for all samples, which is used to calculate the baseline log loss.\n- **D\u00b2 Score**: The D\u00b2 score quantifies how much better the model is compared to the baseline. A score of 1 indicates perfect predictions, while a score of 0 indicates no improvement over the baseline.\n\nThis function provides a useful metric for evaluating classification models, especially when comparing models with different levels of complexity.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called d2_log_loss_score that calculates the D^2 score, which is the fraction of log loss explained. The function takes in the following parameters:\n\n- y_true: array-like or label indicator matrix, representing the actual labels for the samples.\n- y_pred: array-like of shape (n_samples, n_classes) or (n_samples,), representing the predicted probabilities from a classifier.\n- sample_weight: array-like of shape (n_samples,), representing sample weights.\n- labels: array-like, representing the labels. If not provided, they will be inferred from y_true.\n\nThe function returns the D^2 score as a float or ndarray of floats. It may be negative and is not well-defined for a single sample. The best possible score is 1.0, and a model that always predicts the per-class proportions of y_true gets a score of 0.0. The function also handles cases where the number of samples is less than two, returning a NaN value in such cases.if _num_samples(y_pred) < 2:\n        msg = \"D^2 score is not well-defined with less than two samples.\"\n        warnings.warn(msg, UndefinedMetricWarning)\n        return float(\"nan\")",
