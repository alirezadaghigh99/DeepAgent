    "result": "Let's implement the `_grid_from_X` function based on the provided plan. This function will generate a grid of points based on the percentiles of a given dataset `X`. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef _grid_from_X(X, percentiles=(0.05, 0.95), is_categorical=None, grid_resolution=100):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a grid of points based on the percentiles of a given dataset X.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - X: array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)\n    - percentiles: tuple of float, percentiles to consider for grid generation\n    - is_categorical: list of bool, indicating if each feature is categorical\n    - grid_resolution: int, number of points to generate per feature\n\n    Returns:\n    - grid: ndarray, shape (n_points, n_features), the grid of points\n    - values: list of 1d ndarrays, the values used to create the grid\n    \"\"\"\n    X = np.asarray(X)\n    n_features = X.shape[1]\n    \n    if is_categorical is None:\n        is_categorical = [False] * n_features\n    \n    values = []\n    \n    for i in range(n_features):\n        if is_categorical[i]:\n            # Use unique values for categorical features\n            unique_values = np.unique(X[:, i])\n            values.append(unique_values)\n        else:\n            # Calculate percentiles for non-categorical features\n            lower, upper = np.percentile(X[:, i], [percentiles[0] * 100, percentiles[1] * 100])\n            if grid_resolution > len(np.unique(X[:, i])):\n                # Use unique values if grid_resolution is greater than unique values\n                unique_values = np.unique(X[:, i])\n                values.append(unique_values)\n            else:\n                # Generate equally spaced points between the percentiles\n                grid_points = np.linspace(lower, upper, grid_resolution)\n                values.append(grid_points)\n    \n    # Create a cartesian product of the values to form the grid\n    grid = np.array(list(product(*values)))\n    \n    return grid, values\n\n# Example usage:\n# X = np.random.rand(100, 3)  # Example dataset with 100 samples and 3 features\n# grid, values = _grid_from_X(X, percentiles=(0.1, 0.9), is_categorical=[False, True, False], grid_resolution=10)\n# print(\"Grid shape:\", grid.shape)\n# print(\"Values:\", values)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Input Handling**: The function first converts `X` to a NumPy array and determines the number of features. If `is_categorical` is not provided, it defaults to a list of `False`, assuming all features are continuous.\n\n2. **Grid Points Calculation**:\n   - For each feature, it checks if the feature is categorical. If so, it uses the unique values of that feature.\n   - For non-categorical features, it calculates the specified percentiles and generates `grid_resolution` equally spaced points between these percentiles. If the number of unique values is less than `grid_resolution`, it uses the unique values instead.\n\n3. **Cartesian Product**: The function uses `itertools.product` to create a cartesian product of the calculated points for each feature, forming the grid.\n\n4. **Return Values**: The function returns the grid and the list of values used to create the grid.\n\nThis implementation should meet the requirements specified in the task description.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called `_grid_from_X` that generates a grid of points based on the percentiles of a given dataset `X`. The function takes four parameters: `X` (array-like data), `percentiles` (tuple of float values), `is_categorical` (list of boolean values), and `grid_resolution` (integer). \n\nThe function calculates a grid by creating a cartesian product between the columns of `values`, where each column consists of `grid_resolution` equally-spaced points between the percentiles of the corresponding column in `X`. If `grid_resolution` is greater than the number of unique values in a column of `X` or if the feature is categorical (based on `is_categorical`), then the unique values will be used instead.\n\nThe function returns two outputs: `grid`, which is an ndarray containing a value for each feature at each point in the grid, and `values`, which is a list of 1d ndarrays representing the values used to create the grid. The size of each array in `values` is either `grid_resolution` or the number of unique values in the corresponding column of `X`, whichever is smaller.",
