    "result": "The `make_multilabel_classification` function you've described is designed to generate a synthetic multilabel classification dataset. Let's walk through the implementation step-by-step, ensuring that each part of the process is clear and correctly implemented.\n\nHere's the complete implementation of the function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.sparse import csr_matrix\n\ndef make_multilabel_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=20, n_classes=5, n_labels=2, \n                                   length=50, allow_unlabeled=False, sparse=False, \n                                   return_probabilities=False, random_state=None):\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(random_state)\n    \n    # Step 3: Generate class probabilities\n    p_c = rng.dirichlet(alpha=np.ones(n_classes), size=1).flatten()\n    p_w_c = rng.dirichlet(alpha=np.ones(n_features), size=n_classes)\n    \n    # Step 4: Initialize data structures\n    X = np.zeros((n_samples, n_features))\n    Y = np.zeros((n_samples, n_classes), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Step 5: Rejection sampling to generate samples\n    for i in range(n_samples):\n        while True:\n            # Randomly choose classes based on p_c\n            chosen_classes = rng.choice(n_classes, size=n_labels, replace=False, p=p_c)\n            Y[i, chosen_classes] = 1\n            \n            # Generate features based on chosen classes\n            for cls in chosen_classes:\n                X[i] += rng.binomial(1, p_w_c[cls])\n            \n            # Check if the sample meets the criteria\n            if np.sum(Y[i]) == n_labels or allow_unlabeled:\n                break\n            else:\n                Y[i] = 0  # Reset and try again\n    \n    # Step 6: Convert to sparse matrix if required\n    if sparse:\n        X = csr_matrix(X)\n        Y = csr_matrix(Y)\n    \n    # Step 7: Return results\n    if return_probabilities:\n        return X, Y, p_c, p_w_c\n    else:\n        return X, Y\n\n# Example usage\nX, Y = make_multilabel_classification(n_samples=10, n_features=5, n_classes=3, n_labels=2)\nprint(\"Generated Features:\\n\", X)\nprint(\"Generated Labels:\\n\", Y)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Implementation:\n\n1. **Parse Input Parameters**: The function accepts several parameters to control the dataset generation, including the number of samples, features, classes, labels, and other options like whether to allow unlabeled samples or return probabilities.\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures**: Arrays `X` and `Y` are initialized to store the features and labels, respectively.\n\n3. **Generate Class Probabilities**: \n   - `p_c` is a vector of prior probabilities for each class, generated using a Dirichlet distribution.\n   - `p_w_c` is a matrix of conditional probabilities for features given classes, also generated using a Dirichlet distribution.\n\n4. **Rejection Sampling**: \n   - For each sample, classes are chosen based on `p_c`.\n   - Features are generated based on the chosen classes using a binomial distribution.\n   - The sample is accepted if it meets the criteria (e.g., having the correct number of labels), otherwise, it is discarded and regenerated.\n\n5. **Generate Samples and Labels**: The loop continues until all samples are generated according to the specified criteria.\n\n6. **Convert to Sparse Matrix**: If the `sparse` option is set to `True`, the feature and label matrices are converted to sparse format.\n\n7. **Return Results**: The function returns the generated features and labels, and optionally the class and feature probabilities if `return_probabilities` is `True`.\n\nThis implementation provides a flexible way to generate synthetic multilabel classification datasets for testing and experimentation.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called make_multilabel_classification that generates a random multilabel classification problem. The function takes in parameters such as the number of samples, number of features, number of classes, number of labels, document length, and other optional parameters. It returns generated samples X as an ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_features), label sets Y as an ndarray or sparse matrix of shape (n_samples, n_classes), and optionally prior class probability p_c and conditional probabilities of features given classes p_w_c. The function utilizes rejection sampling to ensure valid sample generation. Refer to the User Guide for more information.",
