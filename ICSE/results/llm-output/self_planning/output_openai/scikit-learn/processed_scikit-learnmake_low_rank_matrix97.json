    "result": "Here's a detailed implementation of the `make_low_rank_matrix` function, which generates a mostly low-rank matrix with bell-shaped singular values. This function allows you to specify the number of samples, features, effective rank, tail strength, and random state for reproducibility.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef make_low_rank_matrix(n_samples, n_features, effective_rank, tail_strength=0.1, random_state=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a mostly low-rank matrix with bell-shaped singular values.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - n_samples: int, number of samples (rows).\n    - n_features: int, number of features (columns).\n    - effective_rank: int, approximate rank of the matrix.\n    - tail_strength: float, the relative importance of the noise component.\n    - random_state: int or None, seed for the random number generator.\n\n    Returns:\n    - X: ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_features), the generated matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set up the random state\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(random_state)\n    \n    # Generate singular values with a bell-shaped distribution\n    singular_values = np.exp(-np.linspace(0, 1, min(n_samples, n_features))**2 * effective_rank)\n    \n    # Create orthogonal matrices for left and right singular vectors\n    U, _ = np.linalg.qr(rng.standard_normal((n_samples, n_samples)))\n    V, _ = np.linalg.qr(rng.standard_normal((n_features, n_features)))\n    \n    # Construct the low-rank signal component\n    low_rank_matrix = U @ np.diag(singular_values) @ V.T\n    \n    # Generate noise component\n    noise = rng.standard_normal((n_samples, n_features))\n    \n    # Combine signal and noise\n    X = low_rank_matrix + tail_strength * noise\n    \n    return X\n\n# Example usage\nn_samples = 100\nn_features = 50\neffective_rank = 10\ntail_strength = 0.1\nrandom_state = 42\n\nmatrix = make_low_rank_matrix(n_samples, n_features, effective_rank, tail_strength, random_state)\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Random State**: The `np.random.default_rng` function is used to create a random number generator, which ensures reproducibility when a `random_state` is provided.\n\n2. **Singular Values**: The singular values are generated using an exponential decay function, which creates a bell-shaped distribution. This is controlled by the `effective_rank` parameter.\n\n3. **Orthogonal Matrices**: The function uses QR decomposition to generate orthogonal matrices `U` and `V`. These matrices are used to construct the low-rank signal component of the matrix.\n\n4. **Signal and Noise**: The matrix `X` is a combination of the low-rank signal and a noise component. The `tail_strength` parameter controls the relative importance of the noise.\n\n5. **Return**: The function returns the generated matrix `X`, which has the specified number of samples and features.\n\nThis function is useful for generating synthetic datasets with specific rank characteristics, which can be used to test algorithms that handle low-rank approximations or matrix factorization.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called make_low_rank_matrix that generates a mostly low rank matrix with bell-shaped singular values. The function takes in parameters such as n_samples, n_features, effective_rank, tail_strength, and random_state. It returns a matrix X of shape (n_samples, n_features) that represents the generated low rank matrix. The function utilizes random number generation for dataset creation and constructs the singular profile by combining signal and noise components based on the specified parameters. The function also includes examples of how to use it with sample input values.",
