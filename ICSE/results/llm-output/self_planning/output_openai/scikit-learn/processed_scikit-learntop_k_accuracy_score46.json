It also checks the compatibility of `labels` and `sample_weight` if provided.\n\n2. **Top-k Indices**: It calculates the indices of the top-k scores for each sample using `np.argsort`.\n\n3. **Label Mapping**: If `labels` are provided, it maps the true labels to their corresponding indices.\n\n4. **Correct Predictions**: It checks if the true label is within the top-k predicted labels for each sample.\n\n5. **Sample Weights**: If `sample_weight` is provided, it applies these weights to the correct predictions.\n\n6. **Score Calculation**: It calculates the score as either the fraction of correctly classified samples (if `normalize` is `True`) or the count of correctly classified samples (if `normalize` is `False`).\n\nThis function provides a flexible way to compute the top-k accuracy score, accommodating various input configurations.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called top_k_accuracy_score that calculates the top-k accuracy classification score. The function takes in the following parameters:\n\n- y_true: array-like of shape (n_samples,) representing the true labels.\n- y_score: array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_classes) representing the target scores.\n- k: an integer representing the number of most likely outcomes considered to find the correct label.\n- normalize: a boolean indicating whether to return the fraction of correctly classified samples or the number of correctly classified samples.\n- sample_weight: array-like of shape (n_samples,) representing sample weights.\n- labels: array-like of shape (n_classes,) representing the list of labels that index the classes in y_score.\n\nThe function returns a float value representing the top-k accuracy score. The best performance is 1 with normalize == True and the number of samples with normalize == False. The function also includes examples and additional information about the metric.",
