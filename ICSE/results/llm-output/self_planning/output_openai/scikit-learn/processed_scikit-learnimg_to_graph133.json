    "result": "To create the `img_to_graph` function, we can utilize the `sklearn.feature_extraction.image.img_to_graph` function, which efficiently handles the conversion of an image into a graph representation. This function computes the gradient and constructs the graph internally, allowing us to focus on input validation and handling the output format. Here's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.image import img_to_graph as sklearn_img_to_graph\nfrom scipy.sparse import csr_matrix\n\ndef img_to_graph(img, mask=None, return_as=csr_matrix, dtype=np.float32):\n    # Validate input image\n    if img.ndim not in [2, 3]:\n        raise ValueError(\"Image must be either 2D or 3D.\")\n    \n    # Handle mask\n    if mask is not None:\n        if mask.shape != img.shape[:2]:\n            raise ValueError(\"Mask must have the same height and width as the image.\")\n    \n    # Use sklearn's img_to_graph to handle the conversion\n    graph = sklearn_img_to_graph(img, mask=mask, return_as=return_as, dtype=dtype)\n    \n    return graph\n\n# Example usage:\n# img = np.random.rand(100, 100, 3)  # Example 3D image\n# adjacency_matrix = img_to_graph(img)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation:**\n   - The function checks if the input image (`img`) is either 2D or 3D using `img.ndim`.\n   - If a mask is provided, it checks whether the mask's dimensions match the first two dimensions of the image (height and width).\n\n2. **Gradient Calculation and Graph Construction:**\n   - The `sklearn.feature_extraction.image.img_to_graph` function is used to convert the image into a graph. This function computes the gradient between neighboring pixels and constructs the graph, where each pixel is a node and edges represent the gradient connections.\n\n3. **Adjacency Matrix Construction:**\n   - The adjacency matrix is returned in the format specified by the `return_as` parameter, which defaults to a sparse CSR matrix. The data type of the matrix is set using the `dtype` parameter.\n\n4. **Return the Result:**\n   - The function returns the constructed adjacency matrix, which can be used for further analysis or processing.\n\nThis implementation leverages the efficient computation provided by `sklearn` to handle the conversion of an image to a graph, making it straightforward to use and integrate into various applications.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called img_to_graph that generates a graph of pixel-to-pixel gradient connections from a 2D or 3D image. The function takes in parameters img (array-like of shape (height, width) or (height, width, channel)), mask (optional mask of the image), return_as (class to build the adjacency matrix), and dtype (data type of the returned sparse matrix). The function returns a computed adjacency matrix as either an ndarray or a sparse matrix class. An example is provided using numpy and sklearn.feature_extraction.image to demonstrate how the function works.",
