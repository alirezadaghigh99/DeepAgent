    "result": "To implement the `forward` method for the `RCF` class, we need to follow the steps outlined in the plan. Here's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nclass RCF:\n    def __init__(self, in_channels: int = 4, features: int = 16, kernel_size: int = 3, bias: float = -1.0, seed: int | None = None, mode: str = 'gaussian', dataset: None = None):\n        # Initialize weights and biases\n        self.weights1 = torch.randn(features, in_channels, kernel_size, kernel_size)\n        self.biases1 = torch.full((features,), bias)\n        self.weights2 = torch.randn(features, features, kernel_size, kernel_size)\n        self.biases2 = torch.full((features,), bias)\n        self.num_features = features\n\n    def forward(self, x: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # First convolution and ReLU\n        x = F.conv2d(x, self.weights1, self.biases1)\n        x = F.relu(x)\n        \n        # Second convolution and ReLU\n        x = F.conv2d(x, self.weights2, self.biases2)\n        x = F.relu(x)\n        \n        # Adaptive average pooling\n        x = F.adaptive_avg_pool2d(x, (1, 1))\n        \n        # Flatten the output\n        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)\n        \n        return x\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Implementation:\n\n1. **Weights and Biases Initialization**:\n   - `self.weights1` and `self.weights2` are initialized with random values using `torch.randn`. These represent the weights for the two convolutional layers.\n   - `self.biases1` and `self.biases2` are initialized with a constant value using `torch.full`. These represent the biases for the two convolutional layers.\n\n2. **First Convolution and ReLU**:\n   - The input tensor `x` is passed through the first convolutional layer using `F.conv2d`, with `self.weights1` and `self.biases1`.\n   - The output is then passed through the ReLU activation function using `F.relu`.\n\n3. **Second Convolution and ReLU**:\n   - The result from the first ReLU is passed through the second convolutional layer using `F.conv2d`, with `self.weights2` and `self.biases2`.\n   - The output is again passed through the ReLU activation function.\n\n4. **Adaptive Average Pooling**:\n   - The output from the second ReLU is passed through adaptive average pooling using `F.adaptive_avg_pool2d`, which reduces the spatial dimensions to `(1, 1)`.\n\n5. **Flattening**:\n   - The pooled output is flattened using `x.view(x.size(0), -1)`, which reshapes the tensor to have a shape of `(B, self.num_features)`.\n\n6. **Return**:\n   - The final tensor, which contains the features extracted by the model, is returned.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the forward pass of the `RCF` class processes the input tensor as described, applying convolution, activation, pooling, and flattening to produce the desired output shape.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `forward` for the `RCF` class that performs the forward pass of the model. The method should take as input a tensor `x` with shape `(B, C, H, W)` and return a tensor of size `(B, self.num_features)`. The method should apply two convolution operations using `self.weights` and `self.biases`, followed by ReLU activation. The outputs should be pooled using adaptive average pooling, concatenated, and returned as a single tensor. If a single input is passed, the concatenation should occur along the channel dimension; if a batch is passed, it should occur along the feature dimension.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass RCF:\n    def __init__(self, in_channels: int = 4, features: int = 16, kernel_size: int = 3, bias: float = -1.0, seed: int | None = None, mode: str = 'gaussian', dataset: NonGeoDataset | None = None):\n        self.weights = ...\n        self.biases = ...\n        pass\n\n    def forward(self, x: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
