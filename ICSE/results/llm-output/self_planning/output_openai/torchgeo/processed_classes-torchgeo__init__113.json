    "result": "Here's the implementation of the `__init__` function for the `FCN` class, following the steps you outlined:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass FCN(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, in_channels: int, classes: int, num_filters: int = 64) -> None:\n        super(FCN, self).__init__()\n        \n        # Define the layers\n        self.layers = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Conv2d(in_channels, num_filters, kernel_size=3, padding='same'),\n            nn.LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.01),\n            nn.Conv2d(num_filters, num_filters, kernel_size=3, padding='same'),\n            nn.LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.01),\n            nn.Conv2d(num_filters, num_filters, kernel_size=3, padding='same'),\n            nn.LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.01),\n            nn.Conv2d(num_filters, num_filters, kernel_size=3, padding='same'),\n            nn.LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.01),\n            nn.Conv2d(num_filters, classes, kernel_size=3, padding='same')\n        )\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        return self.layers(x)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Class Definition and Constructor**: The `FCN` class is defined, inheriting from `nn.Module`. The constructor (`__init__`) takes three parameters: `in_channels`, `classes`, and `num_filters`.\n\n2. **Initialize the Parent Class**: The `super(FCN, self).__init__()` call ensures that the parent class (`nn.Module`) is properly initialized.\n\n3. **Define Convolutional Layers**: Five convolutional layers are defined using `nn.Conv2d`. Each layer uses a kernel size of 3x3 and 'same' padding to maintain the input size. The number of filters is specified by `num_filters`.\n\n4. **Add Activation Functions**: After each convolutional layer, a `LeakyReLU` activation function is added with a negative slope of 0.01.\n\n5. **Define the Output Layer**: The final convolutional layer maps the features to the desired number of output classes.\n\n6. **Store Layers in a Sequential Container**: The `nn.Sequential` container is used to store and manage the layers in the correct order, making it easy to apply them sequentially in the `forward` method.\n\nThis implementation provides a straightforward fully convolutional network suitable for tasks like image segmentation or classification, with the flexibility to adjust the number of input channels, output classes, and filters.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python `__init__` function for the `FCN` class that initializes a 5-layer fully convolutional network (FCN) model with leaky ReLUs and 'same' padding. The inputs are the number of input channels, the number of output classes, and the number of filters in each convolutional layer. The output is the initialized `FCN` object.\n\n```python\nclass FCN(Module):\n    def __init__(self, in_channels: int, classes: int, num_filters: int = 64) -> None:\n```",
