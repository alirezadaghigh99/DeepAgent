    "result": "Here's the implementation of the `_normalize` method for the `RCF` class, which performs ZCA whitening on a set of input patches. This method follows the steps outlined in your plan:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nclass RCF:\n    def __init__(self, in_channels: int = 4, features: int = 16, kernel_size: int = 3, bias: float = -1.0, seed: int | None = None, mode: str = 'gaussian', dataset: 'NonGeoDataset' | None = None):\n        self.weights = ...\n        self.biases = ...\n        pass\n\n    def _normalize(self, patches: np.typing.NDArray[np.float32], min_divisor: float = 1e-8, zca_bias: float = 0.001) -> np.typing.NDArray[np.float32]:\n        # Step 1: Remove the Mean\n        mean = np.mean(patches, axis=(1, 2, 3), keepdims=True)\n        patches_centered = patches - mean\n\n        # Step 2: Normalize to Unit Norms\n        norms = np.linalg.norm(patches_centered, axis=(1, 2, 3), keepdims=True)\n        norms = np.maximum(norms, min_divisor)\n        patches_normalized = patches_centered / norms\n\n        # Step 3: ZCA Whitening\n        # Reshape patches to (N, C*H*W) for covariance computation\n        N, C, H, W = patches.shape\n        patches_flat = patches_normalized.reshape(N, -1)\n\n        # Compute covariance matrix\n        covariance_matrix = np.cov(patches_flat, rowvar=False)\n\n        # Add zca_bias to the diagonal\n        covariance_matrix += np.eye(covariance_matrix.shape[0]) * zca_bias\n\n        # Perform SVD\n        U, S, V = np.linalg.svd(covariance_matrix)\n\n        # Compute ZCA whitening matrix\n        zca_matrix = U @ np.diag(1.0 / np.sqrt(S + zca_bias)) @ U.T\n\n        # Apply ZCA whitening\n        patches_whitened = patches_flat @ zca_matrix\n\n        # Reshape back to original shape\n        patches_whitened = patches_whitened.reshape(N, C, H, W)\n\n        return patches_whitened.astype(np.float32)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Remove the Mean**: \n   - The mean of the patches is computed across the spatial dimensions (H, W) and channels (C) for each patch, and this mean is subtracted from the patches to center them around zero.\n\n2. **Normalize to Unit Norms**:\n   - The L2 norm of each patch is computed, and each patch is divided by its norm to ensure it has a unit norm. The `min_divisor` is used to prevent division by zero.\n\n3. **ZCA Whitening**:\n   - The patches are reshaped to a 2D array where each row is a flattened patch.\n   - The covariance matrix of these flattened patches is computed.\n   - A small bias (`zca_bias`) is added to the diagonal of the covariance matrix for numerical stability.\n   - Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is performed on the covariance matrix.\n   - The ZCA whitening matrix is computed using the SVD results.\n   - The ZCA whitening matrix is applied to the flattened patches to decorrelate them.\n\n4. **Return the Normalized Patches**:\n   - The whitened patches are reshaped back to their original shape `(N, C, H, W)` and returned as a NumPy array of type `float32`.\n\nThis method ensures that the input patches are normalized and decorrelated, which can be beneficial for various machine learning tasks.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `_normalize` for the `RCF` class that performs ZCA whitening on a set of input patches. The method should normalize the patches by removing the mean, normalizing the patches to have unit norms, and then applying ZCA whitening. The method should take as input a NumPy array `patches` of shape `(N, C, H, W)` and return a normalized NumPy array of the same shape. Additional parameters should include `min_divisor` to prevent division by zero and `zca_bias` to add a small bias during whitening. The method should follow the ZCA whitening steps as specified in the `mosaiks-paper` repository.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass RCF:\n    def __init__(self, in_channels: int = 4, features: int = 16, kernel_size: int = 3, bias: float = -1.0, seed: int | None = None, mode: str = 'gaussian', dataset: NonGeoDataset | None = None):\n        self.weights = ...\n        self.biases = ...\n        pass\n\n    def _normalize(self, patches: np.typing.NDArray[np.float32], min_divisor: float = 1e-8, zca_bias: float = 0.001) -> np.typing.NDArray[np.float32]:\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
