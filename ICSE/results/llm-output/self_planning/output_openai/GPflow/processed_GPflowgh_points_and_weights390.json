    "result": "The function `gh_points_and_weights` is designed to compute the Gauss-Hermite quadrature points and weights, which are useful for approximating integrals involving the normal distribution. Here's a detailed breakdown of the implementation:\n\n### Steps to Implement the Function:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries**:\n   - We need TensorFlow for tensor operations and SciPy to compute the Gauss-Hermite points and weights.\n\n2. **Compute Gauss-Hermite Points and Weights**:\n   - Use SciPy's `roots_hermite` function to obtain the roots of the Hermite polynomial and the corresponding weights. This function is specifically tailored for Gauss-Hermite quadrature.\n\n3. **Convert to TensorFlow Tensors**:\n   - Convert the points and weights obtained from SciPy into TensorFlow tensors. This is necessary because the function is expected to return TensorFlow tensors, which are often used in machine learning models and other computations within TensorFlow.\n\n4. **Return the Points and Weights**:\n   - Return the points and weights as a tuple of TensorFlow tensors.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom scipy.special import roots_hermite\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\ndef gh_points_and_weights(n_gh: int) -> Tuple[tf.Tensor, tf.Tensor]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Given the number of Gauss-Hermite points n_gh,\n    returns the points z and the weights dz to perform the following\n    uni-dimensional gaussian quadrature:\n\n    X ~ N(mean, stddev\u00b2)\n    E[f(X)] = \u222b f(x) p(x) dx = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_gh} f(mean + stddev*z_i) dz_i\n\n    :param n_gh: Number of Gauss-Hermite points\n    :returns: Points z and weights dz to compute uni-dimensional gaussian expectation\n    \"\"\"\n    # Compute Gauss-Hermite points and weights using SciPy\n    points, weights = roots_hermite(n_gh)\n    \n    # Convert to TensorFlow tensors\n    z = tf.convert_to_tensor(points, dtype=tf.float32)\n    dz = tf.convert_to_tensor(weights, dtype=tf.float32)\n    \n    return z, dz\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **SciPy's `roots_hermite`**: This function is used to compute the roots of the Hermite polynomial and the corresponding weights. These roots and weights are essential for performing Gauss-Hermite quadrature, which is a numerical integration method particularly useful for functions involving the normal distribution.\n\n- **TensorFlow Conversion**: The conversion to TensorFlow tensors ensures that the points and weights can be used seamlessly in TensorFlow-based computations, which is common in machine learning and other numerical applications.\n\n- **Return Type**: The function returns a tuple of two TensorFlow tensors. The first tensor (`z`) contains the Gauss-Hermite points, and the second tensor (`dz`) contains the corresponding weights. These are used to approximate the integral of a function with respect to a normal distribution.\n\nThis implementation provides a robust way to compute the necessary components for Gauss-Hermite quadrature, facilitating efficient and accurate numerical integration in various applications.",
