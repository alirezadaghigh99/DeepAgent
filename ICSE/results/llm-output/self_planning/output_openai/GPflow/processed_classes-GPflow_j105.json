    "result": "Here's the implementation of the `_J` function for the `ArcCosine` class, which handles the computation based on the `order` attribute. The function processes the input tensor `theta` and returns a tensor based on the specified order. Let's go through the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\n\nclass ArcCosine:\n    def __init__(self, order: int):\n        self.order = order\n\n    def _J(self, theta: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        if self.order == 0:\n            # Zeroth-order operation: return a tensor of ones\n            return torch.ones_like(theta)\n        elif self.order == 1:\n            # First-order operation: return the input tensor itself\n            return theta\n        elif self.order == 2:\n            # Second-order operation: return the square of the input tensor\n            return theta ** 2\n        else:\n            # Raise an error for unsupported orders\n            raise ValueError(f\"Unsupported order: {self.order}\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# arc_cosine = ArcCosine(order=1)\n# result = arc_cosine._J(torch.tensor([0.5, 1.0, 1.5]))\n# print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Order 0**: The function returns a tensor of ones with the same shape as `theta`. This is a simple example of a zeroth-order operation, which can be useful for certain types of kernel computations where a constant value is needed.\n\n2. **Order 1**: The function returns the input tensor `theta` itself. This represents a first-order operation, which is essentially a linear transformation where the output is directly proportional to the input.\n\n3. **Order 2**: The function returns the square of the input tensor `theta`. This represents a second-order operation, which is a quadratic transformation. This can be useful in scenarios where the relationship between variables is quadratic.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: If the `order` is not 0, 1, or 2, the function raises a `ValueError` to indicate that the order is not supported. This ensures that the function only processes valid orders and provides clear feedback when an invalid order is specified.\n\nThis implementation provides a basic framework for handling different orders in the `ArcCosine` class. You can adjust the operations for each order based on the specific requirements of your application.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called `_J`  for the ArcCosine class. The input is a tensor `theta`, and the output is a tensor calculated based on the `order` attribute.
