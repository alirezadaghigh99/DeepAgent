    "result": "The function `reshape_Z_dZ` is designed to take sequences of 1D tensors representing points and weights along different dimensions, and return two tensors: one representing the Cartesian product of the points and the other representing the product of the weights. Here's a detailed breakdown of the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom typing import Sequence, Tuple\n\ndef reshape_Z_dZ(\n    zs: Sequence[tf.Tensor], dzs: Sequence[tf.Tensor]\n) -> Tuple[tf.Tensor, tf.Tensor]:\n    \"\"\"\n    :param zs: List with d rank-1 Tensors, with shapes N1, N2, ..., Nd\n    :param dzs: List with d rank-1 Tensors, with shapes N1, N2, ..., Nd\n    :returns: points Z, Tensor with shape [N1*N2*...*Nd, D],\n        and weights dZ, Tensor with shape [N1*N2*...*Nd, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a meshgrid for the points\n    grids = tf.meshgrid(*zs, indexing='ij')\n    # Flatten the grids and stack them to form the Z tensor\n    Z = tf.stack([tf.reshape(grid, [-1]) for grid in grids], axis=-1)\n\n    # Create a meshgrid for the weights\n    weight_grids = tf.meshgrid(*dzs, indexing='ij')\n    # Compute the product of weights for each point\n    dZ = tf.reduce_prod(tf.stack([tf.reshape(wg, [-1]) for wg in weight_grids], axis=-1), axis=-1, keepdims=True)\n\n    return Z, dZ\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Meshgrid Creation**:\n   - `tf.meshgrid(*zs, indexing='ij')` creates a grid of points from the sequences in `zs`. The `indexing='ij'` argument ensures that the Cartesian indexing is used, which is typical for multidimensional data.\n\n2. **Flattening and Stacking**:\n   - Each grid is reshaped into a 1D tensor using `tf.reshape(grid, [-1])`.\n   - These reshaped grids are then stacked along a new last dimension using `tf.stack([...], axis=-1)`, resulting in a 2D tensor `Z` where each row represents a point in the D-dimensional space.\n\n3. **Weight Calculation**:\n   - Similarly, `tf.meshgrid(*dzs, indexing='ij')` creates a grid of weights.\n   - Each weight grid is reshaped and stacked in the same manner as the point grids.\n   - `tf.reduce_prod(..., axis=-1, keepdims=True)` computes the product of weights for each point, resulting in a 2D tensor `dZ` with shape `[N1*N2*...*Nd, 1]`.\n\n4. **Return**:\n   - The function returns the tensors `Z` and `dZ`, representing the Cartesian product of points and the corresponding product of weights, respectively.\n\nThis implementation efficiently handles the transformation of input sequences into the desired output format using TensorFlow operations, making it suitable for use in machine learning and data processing pipelines.",
