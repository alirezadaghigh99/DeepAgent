    "result": "The implementation plan you've outlined for the `_full_weighted_product` function in the `ArcCosine` class is well-structured and covers all necessary steps. Let's walk through the implementation to ensure it aligns with the plan and correctly computes the full weighted product of the input tensors `X` and `X2`.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass ArcCosine:\n    def __init__(self, weight_variances: tf.Tensor, bias_variance: tf.Tensor):\n        self.weight_variances = weight_variances\n        self.bias_variance = bias_variance\n\n    def _full_weighted_product(self, X: tf.Tensor, X2: Optional[tf.Tensor] = None) -> tf.Tensor:\n        # If X2 is None, use X for both inputs\n        if X2 is None:\n            X2 = X\n        \n        # Compute the dot product of X and X2\n        dot_product = tf.matmul(X, X2, transpose_b=True)\n        \n        # Scale the dot product by weight_variances\n        weighted_product = self.weight_variances * dot_product\n        \n        # Add bias_variance to the weighted product\n        full_weighted_product = weighted_product + self.bias_variance\n        \n        return full_weighted_product\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - The `ArcCosine` class is initialized with two attributes: `weight_variances` and `bias_variance`. These are expected to be tensors that will be used in the computation of the weighted product.\n\n2. **Handling `X2`**:\n   - The function checks if `X2` is `None`. If it is, `X2` is set to `X`, allowing the function to compute the weighted product of `X` with itself.\n\n3. **Dot Product Calculation**:\n   - The dot product of `X` and `X2` is computed using `tf.matmul`. The `transpose_b=True` argument ensures that the second matrix is transposed, which is necessary for the dot product when `X2` is a matrix.\n\n4. **Weighting and Bias Addition**:\n   - The dot product is scaled by `weight_variances`. This operation assumes that `weight_variances` is broadcastable to the shape of the dot product.\n   - The `bias_variance` is then added to the scaled dot product to complete the computation of the full weighted product.\n\n5. **Return**:\n   - The function returns the computed tensor, which represents the full weighted product of the input tensors.\n\nThis implementation should work correctly for computing the full weighted product as described, assuming that the input tensors and class attributes are appropriately shaped and initialized.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called `_full_weighted_product` that computes the full weighted product of the input tensors `X` and `X2` using the `weight_variances` and `bias_variance` attributes. If `X2` is `None`, the function computes the weighted product of `X` with itself. The input is a tensor `X` and an optional tensor `X2`, and the output is a tensor representing the weighted product.\n\n```python\nclass ArcCosine(Kernel):\n    def _full_weighted_product(self, X: TensorType, X2: Optional[TensorType]) -> tf.Tensor:\n```",
