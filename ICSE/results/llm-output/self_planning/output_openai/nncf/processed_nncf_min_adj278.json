    "result": "The function `_min_adj` is designed to calculate the minimum adjustment value based on the input parameters: the number of bits, the lower bound, the length of the range, and whether the range is narrow. Here's the implementation of the function, along with an explanation of each step:\n\n```python\ndef _min_adj(bits, low, range_len, narrow_range):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the minimum adjustment value based on the input parameters.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - bits (int): The number of bits used for quantization.\n    - low (float): The lower bound of the range.\n    - range_len (float): The length of the range.\n    - narrow_range (bool): Indicates whether the range is narrow.\n\n    Returns:\n    - float: The minimum adjustment value.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the number of quantization levels\n    quants_count = 2 ** bits\n    if narrow_range:\n        quants_count -= 1\n\n    # Calculate the minimum adjustment value\n    min_adj = range_len / quants_count + low\n\n    return min_adj\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Quantization Levels Calculation**:\n   - The number of quantization levels (`quants_count`) is calculated as \\(2^{\\text{bits}}\\). This represents the total number of discrete levels available for quantization given the number of bits.\n   - If `narrow_range` is `True`, the number of quantization levels is reduced by 1. This adjustment accounts for the narrower range, which effectively means one less level is available for quantization.\n\n2. **Minimum Adjustment Calculation**:\n   - The minimum adjustment value is calculated by dividing the `range_len` by the `quants_count`. This division gives the size of each quantization step.\n   - The result is then adjusted by adding the `low` value, which shifts the quantization levels to start from the specified lower bound.\n\n3. **Return the Result**:\n   - The function returns the calculated minimum adjustment value, which represents the smallest possible adjustment within the specified range and quantization constraints.\n\nThis function is useful in scenarios where you need to determine the smallest quantization step size for a given range and bit depth, taking into account whether the range is narrow.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called _min_adj that calculates the minimum adjustment value based on the input parameters. The function takes in the number of bits (bits), the lower bound (low), the length of the range (range_len), and a boolean value indicating whether the range is narrow (narrow_range). The function calculates the number of quantization levels (quants_count), and then returns the result",
