    "result": "To implement the `select_action` function for the `DDPG` class, we need to follow the steps outlined in your prompt. Here's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import truncnorm\n\nclass DDPG:\n    LBOUND = 0.0\n    RBOUND = 1.0\n\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.actor = None  # actor network\n        self.init_delta = 0.5  # initial delta for noise\n        self.delta_decay = 0.995  # decay rate for delta\n        self.warmup_iter_number = 20  # number of warmup iterations\n        self.nb_actions = nb_actions  # number of actions\n        pass\n\n    def select_action(self, s_t, episode, decay_epsilon=True):\n        # Step 1: Predict the action using the actor network\n        action = self.actor.predict(s_t)  # Assuming actor has a predict method\n\n        # Step 2: Apply noise for exploration\n        if decay_epsilon:\n            # Calculate the current delta\n            current_delta = self.init_delta * (self.delta_decay ** episode)\n            \n            # Define the bounds for the truncated normal distribution\n            lower_bound = -2 * current_delta\n            upper_bound = 2 * current_delta\n            \n            # Sample noise from a truncated normal distribution\n            noise = truncnorm.rvs(\n                (lower_bound - 0) / current_delta, \n                (upper_bound - 0) / current_delta, \n                loc=0, \n                scale=current_delta, \n                size=self.nb_actions\n            )\n            \n            # Add noise to the action\n            action += noise\n\n        # Step 3: Clip the action to be within bounds\n        action = np.clip(action, self.LBOUND, self.RBOUND)\n\n        # Step 4: Return the action\n        return action\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Predict the Action**: The `actor` network is assumed to have a `predict` method that takes the current state `s_t` and outputs an action.\n\n2. **Apply Noise for Exploration**: \n   - If `decay_epsilon` is `True`, noise is added to the action to encourage exploration.\n   - The noise is sampled from a truncated normal distribution. The `truncnorm` function from `scipy.stats` is used to generate noise within a specified range.\n   - The standard deviation of the noise (`current_delta`) decays over time, starting from `self.init_delta` and decreasing by a factor of `self.delta_decay` with each episode.\n\n3. **Clip the Action**: The `np.clip` function ensures that the action values remain within the specified bounds (`LBOUND` and `RBOUND`).\n\n4. **Return the Action**: The final action, after applying noise and clipping, is returned.\n\nThis implementation provides a mechanism for exploration in the DDPG algorithm by adding noise to the actions, which is crucial for learning in continuous action spaces. The use of a truncated normal distribution ensures that the noise remains within a reasonable range, preventing extreme action values.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `select_action` for the class `DDPG` that selects an action based on the current state `s_t` and the current episode number. The function should use the actor network to predict the action, and if `decay_epsilon` is `True`, it should apply noise to the action by sampling from a truncated normal distribution with a decaying standard deviation (`self.delta`). The function should then clip the action to be within the bounds defined by `LBOUND` and `RBOUND`.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass DDPG:\n    LBOUND = 0.0\n    RBOUND = 1.0\n\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.actor = None  # actor network\n        self.init_delta = 0.5  # initial delta for noise\n        self.delta_decay = 0.995  # decay rate for delta\n        self.warmup_iter_number = 20  # number of warmup iterations\n        self.nb_actions = nb_actions  # number of actions\n        pass\n\n    def select_action(self, s_t, episode, decay_epsilon=True):\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```\n\nThis function should output a clipped action that is within the defined bounds, applying noise to encourage exploration during training.",
