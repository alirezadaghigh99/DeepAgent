    "result": "Let's implement the `create_compressed_model_and_algo_for_test` function as described in your request. This function will handle the creation of a compressed model and algorithm using the provided `model`, `NNCFConfig`, and optional parameters. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nfrom nncf import NNCFConfig\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ndef create_compressed_model_and_algo_for_test(model, config, compression_state=None, force_no_init=False):\n    # Step 1: Assert Config Type\n    assert isinstance(config, NNCFConfig), \"The config must be an instance of NNCFConfig.\"\n\n    # Step 2: Clear TensorFlow Session\n    tf.keras.backend.clear_session()\n\n    # Step 3: Handle `force_no_init`\n    if force_no_init:\n        compression_state = {}\n\n    # Step 4: Create Compressed Model and Algorithm\n    # Assuming `create_compressed_model` is a function that takes a model, config, and compression_state\n    # and returns a compressed model and algorithm. This function is part of the NNCF library.\n    compressed_model, compression_algorithm = create_compressed_model(model, config, compression_state)\n\n    # Step 5: Return Outputs\n    return compressed_model, compression_algorithm\n\n# Note: The `create_compressed_model` function is assumed to be part of the NNCF library.\n# You need to ensure that the NNCF library is installed and properly configured in your environment.\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Assert Config Type**: The function first checks if the `config` is an instance of `NNCFConfig`. This ensures that the configuration is valid for the NNCF library.\n\n2. **Clear TensorFlow Session**: The TensorFlow backend session is cleared to reset the state. This is important to ensure that any previous state does not affect the new model creation.\n\n3. **Handle `force_no_init`**: If `force_no_init` is `True`, the `compression_state` is set to an empty dictionary. This means that the compression will start without any pre-existing state.\n\n4. **Create Compressed Model and Algorithm**: The function uses `create_compressed_model` to create the compressed model and algorithm. This function is assumed to be part of the NNCF library, which handles model compression.\n\n5. **Return Outputs**: Finally, the function returns the compressed model and the compression algorithm.\n\nMake sure you have the NNCF library installed and properly configured in your environment to use this function. The `create_compressed_model` function is part of the NNCF library and is responsible for creating the compressed model and algorithm.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called create_compressed_model_and_algo_for_test that takes in a model, a NNCFConfig object called config, an optional compression_state object, and a boolean force_no_init. The function asserts that the config input is an instance of NNCFConfig, clears the TensorFlow backend session, and if force_no_init is True, sets the compression_state to an empty dictionary. It then creates a compressed model and algorithm using the create_compressed_model function, and returns the compressed model and algorithm as outputs.",
