This includes `NNCFNetwork` and `nncf_model_input` from NNCF.\n\n2. **Define the Function Signature**: The function `create_nncf_network` accepts parameters `model`, `config`, `dummy_forward_fn`, `wrap_inputs_fn`, and `wrap_outputs_fn`.\n\n3. **Validate Inputs**: We check if `dummy_forward_fn` is provided, then `wrap_inputs_fn` must also be provided. This ensures that the inputs are correctly wrapped for tracing.\n\n4. **Prepare the Model for Compression**:\n   - If `dummy_forward_fn` is provided, we define a `wrapped_dummy_forward` function that uses `wrap_inputs_fn` to wrap the inputs before calling `dummy_forward_fn`.\n   - If `dummy_forward_fn` is not provided, we directly use the model's `forward` method with the configuration to create the `NNCFNetwork`.\n\n5. **Wrap Inputs and Outputs**:\n   - We use `wrap_inputs_fn` to wrap the model's input arguments if necessary.\n   - We use `wrap_outputs_fn` to wrap the model's outputs if required.\n\n6. **Create NNCFNetwork**: We create an instance of `NNCFNetwork` using the original model and configuration, which is now ready for compression.\n\n7. **Return the Wrapped Model**: Finally, we return the `NNCFNetwork` instance, which is prepared for further compression modifications.\n\nThis implementation provides a flexible way to prepare a PyTorch model for compression using NNCF, accommodating various input and output wrapping needs.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called create_nncf_network that The main function used to produce a model ready for adding compression from an original PyTorch\n    model and a configuration object.\n\n    :param model: The original model.

Specifying this is useful when the original training pipeline\n        has special formats of data loader output or has additional *forward* arguments other than input tensors.\n        Otherwise, the *forward* call of the model during graph tracing will be made with mock tensors according\n        to the shape specified in the config object. The dummy_forward_fn code MUST contain calls to\n        nncf.nncf_model_input\n        functions made with each compressed model input tensor in the underlying model's args/kwargs tuple, and these\n        calls should be exactly the same as in the wrap_inputs_fn function code (see below); if dummy_forward_fn is\n        specified, then wrap_inputs_fn also must be specified.\n    :param wrap_inputs_fn: if supplied, will be used on the module's input arguments during a regular, non-dummy\n        forward call before passing the inputs to the underlying compressed model. This is required if the model's input\n        tensors that are important for compression are not supplied as arguments to the model's forward call directly,\n        but instead are located in a container (such as list), and the model receives the container as an argument.\n        wrap_inputs_fn should take as input two arguments - the tuple of positional arguments to the underlying\n        model's forward call, and a dict of keyword arguments to the same. The function should wrap each tensor among\n        the supplied model's args and kwargs that is important for compression (e.g. quantization) with an\n        nncf.nncf_model_input function, which is a no-operation function and marks the tensors as inputs to be traced\n        by NNCF in the internal graph representation. Output is the tuple of (args, kwargs), where args and kwargs are\n        the same as were supplied in input, but each tensor in the original input.
