    "result": "To implement the `update_delta_decay_factor` function for the `DDPG` class, we need to follow the structured approach you outlined. Here's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nclass DDPG:\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.delta_decay = None  # Initialize the delta decay factor\n        # Other initializations can go here\n\n    def update_delta_decay_factor(self, num_train_episode):\n        # Step 1: Validate input\n        assert num_train_episode > 0, \"Number of training episodes must be greater than zero.\"\n\n        # Step 2: Define decay factor logic\n        if num_train_episode < 1000:\n            # Use specific calibrated values for episodes < 1000\n            self.delta_decay = 0.9  # Example constant value\n        elif 1000 <= num_train_episode <= 3000:\n            # Linear interpolation for episodes between 1000 and 3000\n            start_value = 0.9  # Example start value\n            end_value = 0.5    # Example end value\n            self.delta_decay = start_value + (end_value - start_value) * ((num_train_episode - 1000) / 2000)\n        else:\n            # Constant decay factor for episodes > 3000\n            self.delta_decay = 0.5  # Example constant value\n\n        # Step 3: Optionally return or log the updated value\n        # print(f\"Updated delta decay factor: {self.delta_decay}\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# ddpg = DDPG(nb_states=10, nb_actions=2)\n# ddpg.update_delta_decay_factor(1500)\n# print(ddpg.delta_decay)  # This will print the interpolated decay factor for 1500 episodes\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Validation**: The function begins by asserting that `num_train_episode` is greater than zero. This ensures that the input is valid and prevents any logical errors in the subsequent calculations.\n- **Decay Factor Logic**:\n  - For episodes less than 1000, a constant decay factor of 0.9 is used. This is a placeholder value and can be adjusted based on specific needs or experimental results.\n  - For episodes between 1000 and 3000, a linear interpolation is performed. This smoothly transitions the decay factor from 0.9 to 0.5 as the number of episodes increases from 1000 to 3000.\n  - For episodes greater than 3000, the decay factor is set to a constant value of 0.5.\n- **Flexibility**: The values for the decay factor (0.9 and 0.5) are examples and can be modified to suit different training scenarios or experimental findings.\n\nThis implementation provides a flexible and structured way to update the delta decay factor based on the number of training episodes, ensuring that the decay factor evolves appropriately as training progresses.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `update_delta_decay_factor` for the class `DDPG` that updates the delta decay factor based on the number of training episodes. The function adjusts the decay factor according to specific calibrated values for episodes below 1000, a linear interpolation for episodes between 1000 and 3000, and sets a constant decay factor for episodes beyond 3000. The function raises an assertion error if the number of training episodes is less than or equal to zero.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass DDPG:\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.delta_decay = None  # Initialize the delta decay factor\n        pass\n\n    def update_delta_decay_factor(self, num_train_episode):\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
