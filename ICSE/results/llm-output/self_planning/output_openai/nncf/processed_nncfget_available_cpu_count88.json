    "result": "Certainly! Let's focus on the implementation of the `get_available_cpu_count` function, which is designed to return the number of CPUs in the system. The function takes a boolean parameter `logical` to determine whether to return the number of logical or physical cores. Here's the step-by-step implementation:\n\n### 4. `get_available_cpu_count`\n\n**Plan:**\n1. **Determine CPU Count:** Use the `os` module to get the number of logical CPUs and the `psutil` module to get the number of physical CPUs.\n2. **Handle Logical Parameter:** Return the number of logical or physical cores based on the `logical` parameter.\n3. **Handle Exceptions:** Return 1 if an exception occurs.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef get_available_cpu_count(logical=True):\n    try:\n        if logical:\n            # Return the number of logical CPUs\n            return os.cpu_count()\n        else:\n            # Return the number of physical CPUs\n            import psutil\n            return psutil.cpu_count(logical=False)\n    except Exception:\n        # Return 1 if an exception occurs\n        return 1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Logical CPUs:** The `os.cpu_count()` function is used to get the number of logical CPUs. Logical CPUs include all cores, including hyper-threaded ones.\n  \n- **Physical CPUs:** The `psutil.cpu_count(logical=False)` function is used to get the number of physical CPU cores, excluding hyper-threaded ones. This requires the `psutil` library, which is a third-party module and may need to be installed via `pip install psutil`.\n\n- **Exception Handling:** The function is wrapped in a try-except block to handle any potential exceptions that might occur, such as if `psutil` is not installed. In such cases, the function will return 1 as a fallback.\n\nThis function provides a simple and effective way to determine the number of CPUs available on a system, with flexibility for both logical and physical core counts.",
    "prompt": "Generate a python function called get_available_cpu_count that returns the number of CPUs in the system. The input parameter is a boolean called logical, which determines whether to return the number of physical cores only (if False) or the number of logical cores (if True). The output is an integer representing the number of CPUs. If an exception occurs, the function will return 1. Default value of logical is True",
