    "result": "The provided implementation of the `normalized_mse` function is well-structured and follows the outlined plan to compute the normalized mean square error (NMSE) between two lists of NumPy arrays. Let's go through the function step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements and handles potential edge cases:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function checks if both `ref_outputs` and `approx_outputs` are lists and have the same length. It also verifies that each element in these lists is a NumPy array and that corresponding arrays have the same shape.\n\n2. **Initialization**: A variable `total_nmse` is initialized to accumulate the NMSE values, and `num_pairs` is set to the number of pairs of arrays.\n\n3. **Iteration and Computation**:\n   - For each pair of arrays, the function calculates the mean square error (MSE) between the reference and approximate outputs.\n   - It computes the normalization factor as the MSE between the reference output and a zero array, which is equivalent to the mean of the squared reference output.\n   - The NMSE is calculated by dividing the MSE by the normalization factor. A check is included to ensure the normalization factor is not zero, which would lead to division by zero.\n\n4. **Accumulation and Averaging**: The NMSE for each pair is accumulated, and after processing all pairs, the average NMSE is computed.\n\n5. **Return**: The function returns the average NMSE as a float.\n\nThe function is robust and handles potential issues such as mismatched input lengths, non-array elements, and zero normalization factors. Here is the complete function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef normalized_mse(ref_outputs, approx_outputs):\n    # Step 1: Validate Inputs\n    if not isinstance(ref_outputs, list) or not isinstance(approx_outputs, list):\n        raise ValueError(\"Both ref_outputs and approx_outputs must be lists of NumPy arrays.\")\n    if len(ref_outputs) != len(approx_outputs):\n        raise ValueError(\"ref_outputs and approx_outputs must have the same length.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Initialize Variables\n    total_nmse = 0.0\n    num_pairs = len(ref_outputs)\n    \n    # Step 3: Iterate Over Pairs\n    for ref, approx in zip(ref_outputs, approx_outputs):\n        if not isinstance(ref, np.ndarray) or not isinstance(approx, np.ndarray):\n            raise ValueError(\"Elements of ref_outputs and approx_outputs must be NumPy arrays.\")\n        if ref.shape != approx.shape:\n            raise ValueError(\"Each pair of arrays must have the same shape.\")\n        \n        # Step 4: Compute MSE\n        mse = np.mean((ref - approx) ** 2)\n        \n        # Step 5: Compute Normalization Factor\n        normalization_factor = np.mean(ref ** 2)\n        \n        # Step 6: Calculate NMSE\n        if normalization_factor == 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Normalization factor is zero, cannot compute NMSE.\")\n        nmse = mse / normalization_factor\n        \n        # Step 7: Accumulate NMSE\n        total_nmse += nmse\n    \n    # Step 8: Compute Average NMSE\n    average_nmse = total_nmse / num_pairs\n    \n    # Step 9: Return Result\n    return average_nmse\n```\n\nThis function should work effectively for computing the NMSE between two lists of NumPy arrays, provided the inputs meet the specified conditions.",
