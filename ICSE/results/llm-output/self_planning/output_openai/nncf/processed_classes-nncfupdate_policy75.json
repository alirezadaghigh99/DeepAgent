    "result": "The `update_policy` function for the `DDPG` class is designed to update both the actor and critic networks using experiences sampled from a replay buffer. Here's a detailed breakdown of the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nclass DDPG:\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.memory = None  # replay buffer\n        self.actor = None  # actor network\n        self.actor_target = None  # target actor network\n        self.actor_optim = None  # optimizer for actor network\n        self.critic = None  # critic network\n        self.critic_target = None  # target critic network\n        self.critic_optim = None  # optimizer for critic network\n        self.batch_size = None  # batch size for training\n        self.discount = None  # discount factor\n        self.moving_average = 0.0  # moving average of rewards\n        self.moving_alpha = 0.01  # smoothing factor for moving average\n        self.value_loss = 0.0  # loss for critic network\n        self.policy_loss = 0.0  # loss for actor network\n        self.tau = 0.005  # soft update parameter\n\n    def update_policy(self):\n        # Sample a batch of experiences\n        states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones = self.memory.sample(self.batch_size)\n\n        # Normalize rewards\n        self.moving_average = self.moving_alpha * rewards.mean() + (1 - self.moving_alpha) * self.moving_average\n        rewards = rewards / (self.moving_average + 1e-8)\n\n        # Calculate target Q-values\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            next_actions = self.actor_target(next_states)\n            next_Q = self.critic_target(next_states, next_actions)\n            target_Q = rewards + self.discount * (1 - dones) * next_Q\n\n        # Update critic network\n        current_Q = self.critic(states, actions)\n        critic_loss = F.mse_loss(current_Q, target_Q)\n        self.critic_optim.zero_grad()\n        critic_loss.backward()\n        self.critic_optim.step()\n        self.value_loss = critic_loss.item()\n\n        # Update actor network\n        predicted_actions = self.actor(states)\n        actor_loss = -self.critic(states, predicted_actions).mean()\n        self.actor_optim.zero_grad()\n        actor_loss.backward()\n        self.actor_optim.step()\n        self.policy_loss = actor_loss.item()\n\n        # Soft update target networks\n        for target_param, param in zip(self.actor_target.parameters(), self.actor.parameters()):\n            target_param.data.copy_(self.tau * param.data + (1 - self.tau) * target_param.data)\n\n        for target_param, param in zip(self.critic_target.parameters(), self.critic.parameters()):\n            target_param.data.copy_(self.tau * param.data + (1 - self.tau) * target_param.data)\n```\n\n### Key Steps Explained:\n\n1. **Sample a Batch of Experiences**:\n   - The function retrieves a batch of experiences from the replay buffer. Each experience includes the current state, action, reward, next state, and a done flag.\n\n2. **Normalize the Reward**:\n   - The rewards are normalized using a moving average to stabilize training. This helps in maintaining a consistent scale for the rewards, which can be crucial for learning.\n\n3. **Calculate Target Q-Values**:\n   - The target actor network predicts the next actions for the next states.\n   - The target critic network computes the Q-values for these predicted actions.\n   - The target Q-values are calculated using the Bellman equation, incorporating the discount factor and the done flag to handle episode terminations.\n\n4. **Update the Critic Network**:\n   - The critic network predicts Q-values for the current state-action pairs.\n   - The loss is computed as the mean squared error between the predicted and target Q-values.\n   - The critic network is updated by performing a gradient descent step to minimize this loss.\n\n5. **Update the Actor Network**:\n   - The actor network predicts actions for the current states.\n   - The policy loss is computed as the negative mean of the Q-values predicted by the critic network for these actions. This encourages the actor to choose actions that maximize the Q-value.\n   - The actor network is updated by performing a gradient ascent step to maximize the policy loss.\n\n6. **Soft Update of Target Networks**:\n   - The target networks are updated using a soft update mechanism, which blends the weights of the main networks with the target networks using a parameter `tau`.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the replay buffer (`self.memory`) has a `sample` method that returns batches of states, actions, rewards, next states, and done flags. The actor and critic networks, as well as their optimizers, are assumed to be properly initialized. The `tau` parameter controls the rate of the soft update for the target networks.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `update_policy` for the class `DDPG` that updates the actor and critic networks based on a sampled batch of experiences from the replay buffer. The function should normalize the reward, calculate the target Q-values for the critic, and then update the critic and actor networks accordingly. After updating the networks, it should also perform a soft update on the target networks. The function should update the internal attributes `value_loss` and `policy_loss` for logging purposes.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass DDPG:\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.memory = None  # replay buffer\n        self.actor = None  # actor network\n        self.actor_target = None  # target actor network\n        self.actor_optim = None  # optimizer for actor network\n        self.critic = None  # critic network\n        self.critic_target = None  # target critic network\n        self.critic_optim = None  # optimizer for critic network\n        self.batch_size = None  # batch size for training\n        self.discount = None  # discount factor\n        self.moving_average = None  # moving average of rewards\n        self.moving_alpha = None  # smoothing factor for moving average\n        self.value_loss = 0.0  # loss for critic network\n        self.policy_loss = 0.0  # loss for actor network\n        pass\n\n    def update_policy(self):\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
