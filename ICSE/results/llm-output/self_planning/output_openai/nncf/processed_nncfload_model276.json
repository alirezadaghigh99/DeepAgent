    "result": "To implement the `load_model` function as described, we need to ensure that it can handle both predefined models from `torchvision.models` and any custom models you might have. Additionally, it should be able to load custom weights safely. Here's a detailed implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torchvision.models as models\nimport os\nimport urllib\nimport custom_models  # Assuming custom_models is a module with custom model definitions\n\ndef load_model(model_name, pretrained=False, num_classes=1000, model_params=None, weights_path=None):\n    if model_params is None:\n        model_params = {}\n\n    # Load predefined models from torchvision\n    if hasattr(models, model_name):\n        model = getattr(models, model_name)(pretrained=pretrained, **model_params)\n    # Load custom models if defined\n    elif hasattr(custom_models, model_name):\n        model = getattr(custom_models, model_name)(**model_params)\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Model {model_name} is not defined in torchvision or custom_models.\")\n\n    # Adjust the final layer for the number of classes\n    if hasattr(model, 'fc'):\n        model.fc = torch.nn.Linear(model.fc.in_features, num_classes)\n    elif hasattr(model, 'classifier'):\n        if isinstance(model.classifier, torch.nn.Sequential):\n            model.classifier[-1] = torch.nn.Linear(model.classifier[-1].in_features, num_classes)\n        else:\n            model.classifier = torch.nn.Linear(model.classifier.in_features, num_classes)\n\n    # Load custom weights if specified\n    if not pretrained and weights_path:\n        if os.path.isfile(weights_path):\n            # Load weights safely\n            with open(weights_path, 'rb') as f:\n                state_dict = torch.load(f, map_location='cpu')\n            model.load_state_dict(state_dict)\n        elif urllib.parse.urlparse(weights_path).scheme in ('http', 'https'):\n            # Handle URL download\n            state_dict = torch.hub.load_state_dict_from_url(weights_path, map_location='cpu')\n            model.load_state_dict(state_dict)\n        else:\n            raise FileNotFoundError(f\"Custom weights file not found at {weights_path}\")\n\n    return model\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Import Statements**: \n   - We import necessary modules from `torch` and `torchvision.models`.\n   - We assume `custom_models` is a module containing custom model definitions.\n\n2. **Model Loading**:\n   - We check if the model name is available in `torchvision.models` or `custom_models`.\n   - We use `getattr` to dynamically load the model constructor.\n\n3. **Adjusting the Final Layer**:\n   - We adjust the final layer of the model to match the specified number of classes.\n   - This is done by checking if the model has an `fc` or `classifier` attribute, which is common in many architectures.\n\n4. **Loading Custom Weights**:\n   - If `pretrained` is `False` and a `weights_path` is provided, we load the weights.\n   - We handle both local file paths and URLs for downloading weights.\n   - We ensure safe loading by using `torch.load` with `map_location='cpu'`.\n\n5. **Error Handling**:\n   - We raise a `ValueError` if the model name is not recognized.\n   - We raise a `FileNotFoundError` if the weights file is not found.\n\nThis implementation provides a flexible way to load models with or without pretrained weights and supports custom weights loading from both local files and URLs. Adjustments may be needed based on the specific structure of your custom models and the environment in which this code is used.",
    "prompt": "Implement a function called `load_model` that loads a machine learning model using PyTorch. The function should accept the model name, an optional boolean to indicate if pretrained weights should be used, the number of classes for the model, additional model parameters, and an optional path to custom weights. Depending on the model name, the function either loads a predefined model from `torchvision.models` or `custom_models`, or raises an exception if the model name is undefined. If `pretrained` is set to `False` and a weights path is provided, it loads the custom weights from the specified path, handling potential URL downloads and ensuring safe unpickling. The function returns the loaded model.",
