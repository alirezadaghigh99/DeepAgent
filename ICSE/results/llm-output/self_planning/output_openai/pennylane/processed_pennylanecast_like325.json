    "result": "Let's focus on implementing the `cast_like` function as described in your request. This function will take two parameters, `tensor1` and `tensor2`, and cast `tensor1` to the same data type as `tensor2`. The function should handle cases where the inputs are lists, tuples, or other types like NumPy arrays or PyTorch tensors.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `cast_like` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport torch\n\ndef cast_like(tensor1, tensor2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Casts tensor1 to the same data type as tensor2.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - tensor1: The tensor (or list/tuple) to be casted.\n    - tensor2: The tensor (or list/tuple) whose data type will be used for casting.\n\n    Returns:\n    - The casted version of tensor1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Determine the data type of tensor2\n    if isinstance(tensor2, (list, tuple)):\n        # If tensor2 is a list or tuple, assume all elements have the same type\n        dtype = type(tensor2[0])\n    elif isinstance(tensor2, np.ndarray):\n        dtype = tensor2.dtype\n    elif isinstance(tensor2, torch.Tensor):\n        dtype = tensor2.dtype\n    else:\n        raise TypeError(\"Unsupported type for tensor2\")\n\n    # Cast tensor1 to the determined data type\n    if isinstance(tensor1, (list, tuple)):\n        # If tensor1 is a list or tuple, cast each element\n        casted_tensor1 = type(tensor1)(dtype(x) for x in tensor1)\n    elif isinstance(tensor1, np.ndarray):\n        casted_tensor1 = tensor1.astype(dtype)\n    elif isinstance(tensor1, torch.Tensor):\n        casted_tensor1 = tensor1.to(dtype)\n    else:\n        raise TypeError(\"Unsupported type for tensor1\")\n\n    return casted_tensor1\n\n# Example usage:\n# tensor1 = [1, 2, 3]\n# tensor2 = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\n# casted_tensor1 = cast_like(tensor1, tensor2)\n# print(casted_tensor1)  # Output: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Determine the Data Type of `tensor2`:**\n   - If `tensor2` is a list or tuple, we assume all elements have the same type and use the type of the first element.\n   - If `tensor2` is a NumPy array, we use its `dtype`.\n   - If `tensor2` is a PyTorch tensor, we use its `dtype`.\n   - If `tensor2` is of an unsupported type, we raise a `TypeError`.\n\n2. **Cast `tensor1`:**\n   - If `tensor1` is a list or tuple, we cast each element to the determined data type.\n   - If `tensor1` is a NumPy array, we use `astype` to cast it.\n   - If `tensor1` is a PyTorch tensor, we use `to` to cast it.\n   - If `tensor1` is of an unsupported type, we raise a `TypeError`.\n\n3. **Return the Casted Tensor:**\n   - The function returns the casted version of `tensor1`.\n\nThis implementation should handle the casting of `tensor1` to match the data type of `tensor2` for the specified input types.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called cast_like that takes in two parameters, tensor1 and tensor2. The function casts tensor1 to the same data type as tensor2.\n\nYou should be aware that input can be list or tuple aswell.",
