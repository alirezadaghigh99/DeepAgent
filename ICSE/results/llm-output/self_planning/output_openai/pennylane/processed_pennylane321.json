This ensures compatibility for element-wise operations, regardless of the original data type (e.g., PyTorch tensors, lists).\n\n2. **Element-wise Comparison**:\n   - The `==` operator is used to compare the two arrays element-wise, resulting in a boolean array where each element is `True` if the corresponding elements in `tensor1` and `tensor2` are equal, and `False` otherwise.\n\n3. **Apply `np.all` with `kwargs`**:\n   - The `np.all()` function is used to determine if all elements in the boolean array are `True`. The `**kwargs` allows the function to accept additional parameters like `axis`, `out`, and `keepdims`, which can modify the behavior of `np.all`.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - If `axis=None`, `np.all` returns a single boolean value indicating if all elements are equal. If an axis is specified, it returns a boolean array indicating equality along that axis.\n\nThis implementation is flexible and can handle a variety of input types and configurations, making it a robust solution for element-wise tensor comparison.",
