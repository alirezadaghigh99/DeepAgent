    "result": "Here's the implementation of the `_coefficients_no_filter` function, which computes the first \\(2d+1\\) Fourier coefficients for a \\(2\\pi\\)-periodic function. This function is designed to handle both single and multi-dimensional inputs and can leverage broadcasting for performance optimization.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef _coefficients_no_filter(f, degree, use_broadcasting=True):\n    # Determine the range of frequencies\n    if isinstance(degree, int):\n        freq_range = range(-degree, degree + 1)\n    elif isinstance(degree, tuple) and len(degree) == 2:\n        freq_range = range(degree[0], degree[1] + 1)\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Degree must be an integer or a tuple of two integers.\")\n    \n    # Set up evaluation points\n    num_points = 1024  # Number of sample points\n    x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, num_points, endpoint=False)\n    \n    # Evaluate the function\n    if use_broadcasting:\n        y = f(x)\n    else:\n        y = np.array([f(xi) for xi in x])\n    \n    # Compute the Fourier coefficients using DFT\n    y_fft = np.fft.fft(y) / num_points\n    \n    # Shift zero frequency to the center\n    y_fft = np.fft.fftshift(y_fft)\n    \n    # Extract the coefficients for the specified frequency range\n    center = num_points // 2\n    coeffs = y_fft[center + freq_range[0]: center + freq_range[-1] + 1]\n    \n    return coeffs\n\n# Example usage:\n# Define a sample function\ndef sample_function(x):\n    return np.sin(x) + 0.5 * np.cos(2 * x)\n\n# Compute coefficients\ncoeffs = _coefficients_no_filter(sample_function, degree=5)\nprint(coeffs)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Parsing**:\n   - The function accepts a callable `f`, an integer or tuple `degree`, and a boolean `use_broadcasting`.\n   - It checks if `degree` is an integer or a tuple and sets up the frequency range accordingly.\n\n2. **Evaluation Points**:\n   - The function uses 1024 sample points, which is a power of two, to ensure efficient computation with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).\n   - It creates an array `x` of equally spaced points over the interval \\([0, 2\\pi]\\).\n\n3. **Function Evaluation**:\n   - If `use_broadcasting` is `True`, the function `f` is evaluated at all points simultaneously using NumPy's broadcasting.\n   - If `use_broadcasting` is `False`, the function is evaluated at each point in a loop.\n\n4. **Fourier Coefficients Calculation**:\n   - The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is computed using `np.fft.fft`, and the result is normalized by dividing by the number of points.\n   - The zero frequency component is shifted to the center using `np.fft.fftshift`.\n\n5. **Extracting Coefficients**:\n   - The coefficients corresponding to the specified frequency range are extracted and returned as a NumPy array of complex numbers.\n\nThis function is efficient and versatile, suitable for computing Fourier coefficients for various \\(2\\pi\\)-periodic functions.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `_coefficients_no_filter` that computes the first \\(2d+1\\) Fourier coefficients for a \\(2\\pi\\)-periodic function, serving as a helper to compute these coefficients without filtering. The function takes a callable `f`, an integer or tuple `degree` representing the maximum frequency, and a boolean `use_broadcasting` to decide whether to use broadcasting for simultaneous function evaluations. It returns a NumPy array of complex numbers containing the Fourier coefficients up to the specified degree. The function should efficiently handle multi-dimensional inputs and leverage broadcasting for performance optimization.",
