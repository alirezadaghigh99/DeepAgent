    "result": "To implement the `_walsh_hadamard_transform` function, we need to ensure that it efficiently computes the Walsh-Hadamard Transform using matrix operations that are compatible with autodifferentiation frameworks. Here's the complete implementation following the outlined steps:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef _walsh_hadamard_transform(D, n=None):\n    # Validate that the length of D is a power of two\n    length = len(D)\n    if (length & (length - 1)) != 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Length of D must be a power of two.\")\n    \n    # Determine n if not provided\n    if n is None:\n        n = int(np.log2(length))\n    \n    # Reshape D for the transform\n    D = np.asarray(D)\n    \n    # Construct the Hadamard matrix\n    def hadamard_matrix(order):\n        if order == 1:\n            return np.array([[1]])\n        else:\n            H = hadamard_matrix(order // 2)\n            return np.block([[H, H], [H, -H]])\n    \n    H = hadamard_matrix(2**n)\n    \n    # Apply the Hadamard transform\n    transformed = np.dot(H, D)\n    \n    # Reshape the output to match the input shape\n    transformed = transformed.reshape(D.shape)\n    \n    return transformed\n\n# Example usage:\n# D = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\n# result = _walsh_hadamard_transform(D)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the length of `D` is a power of two. This is done using the bitwise operation `(length & (length - 1))`, which is a common trick to check for powers of two.\n\n2. **Determine Transform Size**: If `n` is not provided, it is calculated as the base-2 logarithm of the length of `D`, which gives the number of qubits or the size of the transform.\n\n3. **Reshape Input**: The input `D` is converted to a NumPy array to ensure compatibility with matrix operations.\n\n4. **Construct Hadamard Matrix**: The Hadamard matrix is constructed recursively. For an order of 1, it returns a 1x1 matrix. For higher orders, it constructs the matrix using the Kronecker product structure, which is efficiently implemented using `np.block`.\n\n5. **Apply Hadamard Transform**: The Hadamard transform is applied using matrix multiplication (`np.dot`), which is compatible with autodifferentiation frameworks.\n\n6. **Reshape Output**: The transformed data is reshaped to match the original shape of `D`.\n\n7. **Return Result**: The transformed tensor is returned.\n\nThis implementation is efficient and leverages NumPy's capabilities to handle matrix operations, making it suitable for use in contexts where autodifferentiation is required, such as quantum computing simulations.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `_walsh_hadamard_transform` that computes the Walsh-Hadamard Transform for a one-dimensional tensor or array `D`, where the length of `D` must be a power of two. The function should optionally take an integer `n`, representing the number of qubits or the size of the transform, and default to calculating it based on the shape of `D`. The function should efficiently reshape `D`, apply the Hadamard transform using tensor operations, and then return the transformed tensor with the same shape as the input. The approach should use tensor multiplications that are compatible with autodifferentiation frameworks, making it suitable for use in quantum computing or other advanced mathematical contexts.",
