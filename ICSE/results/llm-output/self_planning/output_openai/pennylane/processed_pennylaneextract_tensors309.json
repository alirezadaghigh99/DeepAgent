If it is, we yield it directly.\n\n3. **Sequence Handling**: If `x` is not a single tensor, we attempt to treat it as an iterable. We use `iter(x)` to get an iterator. If `x` is not iterable, a `TypeError` is raised, and we handle it by raising a `ValueError` with a descriptive message.\n\n4. **Iterate and Yield**: We iterate over the sequence and check each item. If an item is a PennyLane tensor, we yield it.\n\nThis function is designed to be robust, handling both single tensor inputs and sequences of items, while also providing informative error messages if the input is not as expected.",
