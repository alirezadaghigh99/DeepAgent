The input should be a list of numpy arrays with dimensions (n_points x n_dims) ordered from lowest to highest fidelity. The output should be a numpy array with the features and fidelity index concatenated. If any of the arrays in x_list do not have 2 dimensions, a ValueError should be raised. raise value error of All x arrays must have 2 dimensions",
