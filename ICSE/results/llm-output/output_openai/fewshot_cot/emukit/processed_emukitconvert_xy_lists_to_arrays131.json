The function returns a Tuple containing two numpy arrays: x_array and y_array. \n\nThe x_list parameter is a list of numpy arrays representing inputs, ordered from lowest to highest fidelity. The y_list parameter is a list of numpy arrays representing outputs, also ordered from lowest to highest fidelity. \n\nThe function first checks if the lengths of x_list and y_list are equal, raising a ValueError if they are not. It then checks if the number of points in each fidelity level is the same for both x_list and y_list, raising a ValueError if they are not. \n\nThe x_array returned contains all inputs across all fidelities with the fidelity index appended as the last column. The y_array returned contains all outputs across all fidelities. \n\nIf the function encounters any errors during the conversion process, it will raise appropriate ValueErrors.",
