    "prompt": "Write a Python function `subloss` for the class `SwaVLoss` that calculates the cross-entropy loss between the predictions and the computed codes. The function should take two tensors `z` (similarity of features and prototypes) and `q` (codes obtained from Sinkhorn iterations) as input and return the cross-entropy loss as a `torch.Tensor`. Here is the class structure:\n\n```python\nclass SwaVLoss(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        temperature: float = 0.1,\n        sinkhorn_iterations: int = 3,\n        sinkhorn_epsilon: float = 0.05,\n        sinkhorn_gather_distributed: bool = False,\n    ):\n        super(SwaVLoss, self).__init__()\n        self.temperature = temperature\n        self.sinkhorn_iterations = sinkhorn_iterations\n        self.sinkhorn_epsilon = sinkhorn_epsilon\n        self.sinkhorn_gather_distributed = sinkhorn_gather_distributed\n\n    def subloss(self, z: torch.Tensor, q: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n```",
