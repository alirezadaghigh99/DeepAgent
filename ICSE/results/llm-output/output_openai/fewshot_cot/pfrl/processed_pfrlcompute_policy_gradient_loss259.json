The function takes in the following inputs: action (the action taken), advantage (the advantage of taking that action), action_distrib (the distribution of actions), action_distrib_mu (the distribution of actions from the behavior policy), action_value (the value of the action taken), v (the value function), and truncation_threshold (optional threshold for truncating the off-policy policy gradient term). The function returns the policy gradient loss as a scalar value.",
