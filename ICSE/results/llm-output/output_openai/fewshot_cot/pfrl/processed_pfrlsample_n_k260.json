    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called sample_n_k that samples k distinct elements uniformly from the range 0 to n. The inputs are two integers, n and k. The function will raise a ValueError if k is larger than n or is negative. If k is 0, the function will return an empty NumPy array. If 3 times k is greater than or equal to n, the function will use NumPy's random.choice function to sample k elements without replacement. Otherwise, the function will sample 2k elements and ensure that they are distinct before returning the first k elements. The output of the function is a NumPy array containing k distinct elements sampled from the range 0 to n.",
