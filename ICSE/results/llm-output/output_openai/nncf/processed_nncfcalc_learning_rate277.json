    "result": "To implement the `calc_learning_rate` function, we need to handle different learning rate schedules. The primary focus here is on the \"cosine\" schedule, which is a popular method for adjusting the learning rate during training. The cosine annealing schedule gradually decreases the learning rate following a cosine curve, which can help in achieving better convergence in some training scenarios.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `calc_learning_rate` function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calc_learning_rate(current_epoch, initial_lr, total_epochs, current_batch, total_batches_per_epoch, lr_schedule_type=\"cosine\"):\n    if lr_schedule_type == \"cosine\":\n        # Calculate the total number of iterations (epochs * batches per epoch)\n        total_iterations = total_epochs * total_batches_per_epoch\n        # Calculate the current iteration\n        current_iteration = current_epoch * total_batches_per_epoch + current_batch\n        # Calculate the cosine annealing learning rate\n        lr = initial_lr * 0.5 * (1 + math.cos(math.pi * current_iteration / total_iterations))\n        return lr\n    elif lr_schedule_type == \"\":\n        # If no schedule type is provided, return the initial learning rate\n        return initial_lr\n    else:\n        # Raise an error for unsupported schedule types\n        raise ValueError(\"do not support: %s\" % lr_schedule_type)\n\n# Example usage:\n# current_epoch = 5\n# initial_lr = 0.1\n# total_epochs = 100\n# current_batch = 10\n# total_batches_per_epoch = 50\n# print(calc_learning_rate(current_epoch, initial_lr, total_epochs, current_batch, total_batches_per_epoch))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Cosine Annealing Schedule**:\n   - The cosine annealing schedule is calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{lr} = \\text{initial\\_lr} \\times 0.5 \\times \\left(1 + \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi \\times \\text{current\\_iteration}}{\\text{total\\_iterations}}\\right)\\right)\n     \\]\n   - `current_iteration` is calculated as the sum of the completed epochs and the current batch within the current epoch.\n   - `total_iterations` is the total number of training steps, which is the product of `total_epochs` and `total_batches_per_epoch`.\n\n2. **Default Behavior**:\n   - If no schedule type is provided (an empty string), the function returns the initial learning rate.\n\n3. **Error Handling**:\n   - If an unsupported schedule type is provided, the function raises a `ValueError` with a descriptive message.\n\nThis implementation provides a flexible way to adjust the learning rate based on the specified schedule type, with a focus on the cosine annealing method.",
    "prompt": "You need to implement a function called `calc_learning_rate` that calculates the learning rate during training based on the provided schedule type. The function takes inputs for the current epoch, initial learning rate, total epochs, current batch, total batches per epoch, and the learning rate schedule type, which defaults to \"cosine.\" If \"cosine\" is selected, the learning rate should be calculated using a cosine annealing schedule; otherwise, if no schedule type is provided, return the initial learning rate. If an unsupported schedule type is given, raise ValueError(\"do not support: %s\" % lr_schedule_type) The function outputs the calculated learning rate as a float.",
