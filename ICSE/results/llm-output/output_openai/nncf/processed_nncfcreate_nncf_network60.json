    "result": "To create the `create_nncf_network` function as described, we need to integrate the NNCF (Neural Network Compression Framework) library with a PyTorch model. This function will take a PyTorch model and a configuration object, and prepare the model for compression by wrapping it with NNCF's `NNCFNetwork`. The function will also handle optional parameters for custom forward functions and input/output wrapping.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of the `create_nncf_network` function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom nncf import NNCFNetwork\nfrom nncf.dynamic_graph.context import TracingContext\nfrom nncf.dynamic_graph.graph_builder import create_input_infos\nfrom nncf.nncf_network import InputInfo\n\ndef create_nncf_network(model, config, dummy_forward_fn=None, wrap_inputs_fn=None, wrap_outputs_fn=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Produces a model ready for adding compression from an original PyTorch model and a configuration object.\n\n    :param model: The original model. Should have its parameters already loaded from a checkpoint or another source.\n    :param config: A configuration object used to determine the exact compression modifications to be applied to the model.\n    :param dummy_forward_fn: If supplied, will be used instead of a *forward* function call to build the internal graph\n                             representation via tracing.\n    :param wrap_inputs_fn: If supplied, will be used on the module's input arguments during a regular, non-dummy forward call.\n    :param wrap_outputs_fn: Same as `wrap_inputs_fn`, but for marking model outputs.\n\n    :return: A model wrapped by NNCFNetwork, which is ready for adding compression.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create input information from the config\n    input_infos = create_input_infos(config)\n\n    # Create a tracing context\n    tracing_context = TracingContext()\n\n    # Wrap the model with NNCFNetwork\n    nncf_network = NNCFNetwork(\n        model,\n        input_infos=input_infos,\n        dummy_forward_fn=dummy_forward_fn,\n        wrap_inputs_fn=wrap_inputs_fn,\n        wrap_outputs_fn=wrap_outputs_fn,\n        tracing_context=tracing_context\n    )\n\n    return nncf_network\n\n# Example usage:\n# model = ...  # Load your PyTorch model\n# config = ...  # Define your NNCF configuration\n# nncf_model = create_nncf_network(model, config)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Information**: The function uses `create_input_infos` to generate input information from the configuration object. This helps in defining the input shapes and types expected by the model.\n\n2. **Tracing Context**: A `TracingContext` is created to manage the graph tracing process. This context is used by NNCF to trace the model's operations and build an internal graph representation.\n\n3. **NNCFNetwork Wrapping**: The model is wrapped with `NNCFNetwork`, which prepares it for compression. This involves setting up the necessary hooks and modifications to the model's forward pass.\n\n4. **Optional Parameters**: The function supports optional parameters for custom forward functions (`dummy_forward_fn`) and input/output wrapping (`wrap_inputs_fn`, `wrap_outputs_fn`). These allow for more complex data handling scenarios, such as when inputs are not directly passed to the model's forward method.\n\nThis function assumes that the NNCF library is installed and properly configured in your environment. You may need to adjust the implementation based on the specific version of NNCF you are using, as APIs can change over time.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called create_nncf_network that The main function used to produce a model ready for adding compression from an original PyTorch\n    model and a configuration object.\n\n    :param model: The original model.

Specifying this is useful when the original training pipeline\n        has special formats of data loader output or has additional *forward* arguments other than input tensors.\n        Otherwise, the *forward* call of the model during graph tracing will be made with mock tensors according\n        to the shape specified in the config object.
