    "result": "To implement the `select_action` function for the `DDPG` class, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Use the actor network to predict the action based on the current state `s_t`.\n2. If `decay_epsilon` is `True`, apply noise to the action. The noise should be sampled from a truncated normal distribution with a standard deviation that decays over time.\n3. Clip the action to ensure it stays within the bounds defined by `LBOUND` and `RBOUND`.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import truncnorm\n\nclass DDPG:\n    LBOUND = 0.0\n    RBOUND = 1.0\n\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.actor = None  # This should be your actor network, e.g., a neural network model\n        self.init_delta = 0.5  # initial delta for noise\n        self.delta_decay = 0.995  # decay rate for delta\n        self.warmup_iter_number = 20  # number of warmup iterations\n        self.nb_actions = nb_actions  # number of actions\n        self.delta = self.init_delta  # current delta for noise\n\n    def select_action(self, s_t, episode, decay_epsilon=True):\n        # Predict the action using the actor network\n        action = self.actor.predict(s_t)  # Assuming actor has a predict method\n\n        if decay_epsilon:\n            # Decay the delta over time\n            self.delta *= self.delta_decay\n\n            # Sample noise from a truncated normal distribution\n            noise = truncnorm.rvs(\n                (self.LBOUND - action) / self.delta, \n                (self.RBOUND - action) / self.delta, \n                loc=0, \n                scale=self.delta, \n                size=self.nb_actions\n            )\n\n            # Add noise to the action\n            action += noise\n\n        # Clip the action to be within the bounds\n        action = np.clip(action, self.LBOUND, self.RBOUND)\n\n        return action\n\n# Example usage:\n# ddpg = DDPG(nb_states=4, nb_actions=2)\n# action = ddpg.select_action(s_t=np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]), episode=5)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Actor Network Prediction**: The `actor.predict(s_t)` is assumed to be a method of the actor network that takes the current state `s_t` and returns the predicted action. You need to replace this with the actual method you use to get predictions from your actor network.\n\n- **Noise Application**: If `decay_epsilon` is `True`, noise is added to the action. The noise is sampled from a truncated normal distribution to ensure it stays within the bounds. The standard deviation of the noise (`self.delta`) decays over time to reduce exploration as training progresses.\n\n- **Clipping**: The action is clipped to ensure it remains within the specified bounds (`LBOUND` and `RBOUND`).\n\nThis function encourages exploration by adding noise to the actions, especially in the early stages of training, and gradually reduces exploration as the model becomes more confident in its predictions.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `select_action` for the class `DDPG` that selects an action based on the current state `s_t` and the current episode number. The function should use the actor network to predict the action, and if `decay_epsilon` is `True`, it should apply noise to the action by sampling from a truncated normal distribution with a decaying standard deviation (`self.delta`). The function should then clip the action to be within the bounds defined by `LBOUND` and `RBOUND`.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass DDPG:\n    LBOUND = 0.0\n    RBOUND = 1.0\n\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.actor = None  # actor network\n        self.init_delta = 0.5  # initial delta for noise\n        self.delta_decay = 0.995  # decay rate for delta\n        self.warmup_iter_number = 20  # number of warmup iterations\n        self.nb_actions = nb_actions  # number of actions\n        pass\n\n    def select_action(self, s_t, episode, decay_epsilon=True):\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```\n\nThis function should output a clipped action that is within the defined bounds, applying noise to encourage exploration during training.",
