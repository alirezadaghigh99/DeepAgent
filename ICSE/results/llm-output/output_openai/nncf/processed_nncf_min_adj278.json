    "result": "To create the `_min_adj` function, we need to calculate the minimum adjustment value based on the given parameters. The function will compute the number of quantization levels and then return the result. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef _min_adj(bits, low, range_len, narrow_range):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the minimum adjustment value based on the input parameters.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - bits (int): The number of bits used for quantization.\n    - low (float): The lower bound of the range.\n    - range_len (float): The length of the range.\n    - narrow_range (bool): A boolean indicating whether the range is narrow.\n\n    Returns:\n    - float: The minimum adjustment value.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the number of quantization levels\n    quants_count = 2 ** bits\n\n    # If the range is narrow, adjust the quantization levels\n    if narrow_range:\n        quants_count -= 1\n\n    # Calculate the minimum adjustment value\n    min_adj_value = range_len / quants_count\n\n    return min_adj_value\n\n# Example usage:\nbits = 8\nlow = 0.0\nrange_len = 1.0\nnarrow_range = False\n\nresult = _min_adj(bits, low, range_len, narrow_range)\nprint(\"Minimum Adjustment Value:\", result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Quantization Levels Calculation**:\n   - The number of quantization levels (`quants_count`) is calculated as \\(2^{\\text{bits}}\\). This represents the total number of discrete values that can be represented with the given number of bits.\n\n2. **Narrow Range Adjustment**:\n   - If `narrow_range` is `True`, the number of quantization levels is reduced by 1. This is because a narrow range might imply that one less level is used for quantization.\n\n3. **Minimum Adjustment Calculation**:\n   - The minimum adjustment value is calculated by dividing the `range_len` by the `quants_count`. This gives the smallest possible step size between quantized values within the specified range.\n\nThis function can be used to determine the smallest adjustment step for a given quantization setup, which is useful in scenarios like digital signal processing or data compression where quantization is involved.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called _min_adj that calculates the minimum adjustment value based on the input parameters. The function takes in the number of bits (bits), the lower bound (low), the length of the range (range_len), and a boolean value indicating whether the range is narrow (narrow_range). The function calculates the number of quantization levels (quants_count), and then returns the result",
