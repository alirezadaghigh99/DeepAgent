    "result": "To implement the `save_model` function for the `DDPG` class, you need to save the state dictionaries of the actor and critic networks to files. In PyTorch, the state dictionary of a model contains all the parameters of the model, and it can be saved using the `torch.save` function. Here's how you can implement the `save_model` function:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport torch\n\nclass DDPG:\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.actor = None  # actor network\n        self.critic = None  # critic network\n        # Initialize actor and critic networks here\n        pass\n\n    def save_model(self, output):\n        # Ensure the output directory exists\n        os.makedirs(output, exist_ok=True)\n        \n        # Save the actor's state dictionary\n        actor_path = os.path.join(output, 'actor.pkl')\n        torch.save(self.actor.state_dict(), actor_path)\n        \n        # Save the critic's state dictionary\n        critic_path = os.path.join(output, 'critic.pkl')\n        torch.save(self.critic.state_dict(), critic_path)\n\n        print(f\"Actor model saved to {actor_path}\")\n        print(f\"Critic model saved to {critic_path}\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# ddpg = DDPG(nb_states=10, nb_actions=2)\n# ddpg.save_model('/path/to/output/directory')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Directory Creation**: The `os.makedirs(output, exist_ok=True)` line ensures that the specified output directory exists. If it doesn't exist, it will be created. The `exist_ok=True` parameter prevents an error if the directory already exists.\n\n2. **Saving State Dictionaries**: \n   - The `torch.save(self.actor.state_dict(), actor_path)` line saves the state dictionary of the actor network to a file named `actor.pkl` in the specified output directory.\n   - Similarly, `torch.save(self.critic.state_dict(), critic_path)` saves the state dictionary of the critic network to `critic.pkl`.\n\n3. **Feedback**: After saving, the function prints out the paths where the models have been saved, which can be useful for debugging and confirmation.\n\nThis function assumes that the `actor` and `critic` attributes of the `DDPG` class are PyTorch models with a `state_dict()` method, which is typical for neural network models in PyTorch.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `save_model` for the class `DDPG` that saves the weights of the actor and critic networks to a specified output directory. The function should save the actor's state dictionary as `actor.pkl` and the critic's state dictionary as `critic.pkl` within the given output directory.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass DDPG:\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.actor = None  # actor network\n        self.critic = None  # critic network\n        pass\n\n    def save_model(self, output):\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```\n\nThis function will save the model's actor and critic networks' weights to the specified output directory, ensuring that the models can be reloaded later.",
