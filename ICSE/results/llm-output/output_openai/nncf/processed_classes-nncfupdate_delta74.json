    "result": "To implement the `update_delta_decay_factor` method for the `DDPG` class, we need to follow the specified logic for updating the delta decay factor based on the number of training episodes. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nclass DDPG:\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.delta_decay = None  # Initialize the delta decay factor\n        # Other initializations can be added here\n\n    def update_delta_decay_factor(self, num_train_episode):\n        # Ensure the number of training episodes is positive\n        assert num_train_episode > 0, \"Number of training episodes must be greater than zero.\"\n\n        # Update delta decay factor based on the number of training episodes\n        if num_train_episode < 1000:\n            # Set a specific calibrated value for episodes below 1000\n            self.delta_decay = 0.9  # Example calibrated value\n        elif 1000 <= num_train_episode <= 3000:\n            # Linearly interpolate between two values for episodes between 1000 and 3000\n            # For example, interpolate between 0.9 and 0.5\n            start_value = 0.9\n            end_value = 0.5\n            self.delta_decay = start_value + (end_value - start_value) * ((num_train_episode - 1000) / (3000 - 1000))\n        else:\n            # Set a constant decay factor for episodes beyond 3000\n            self.delta_decay = 0.5  # Example constant value\n\n# Example usage:\n# ddpg = DDPG(nb_states=10, nb_actions=2)\n# ddpg.update_delta_decay_factor(1500)\n# print(ddpg.delta_decay)  # This will print the interpolated value for 1500 episodes\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Assertion**: The function starts by asserting that the number of training episodes is greater than zero. This ensures that the function is used correctly.\n- **Calibrated Value for <1000 Episodes**: For episodes below 1000, a specific calibrated value (e.g., 0.9) is assigned to `delta_decay`.\n- **Linear Interpolation for 1000-3000 Episodes**: For episodes between 1000 and 3000, the `delta_decay` is linearly interpolated between two values (e.g., 0.9 and 0.5). This is done using a simple linear interpolation formula.\n- **Constant Value for >3000 Episodes**: For episodes beyond 3000, a constant value (e.g., 0.5) is assigned to `delta_decay`.\n\nThis implementation provides a flexible way to adjust the delta decay factor based on the training progress, which can be crucial for the performance of the DDPG algorithm.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `update_delta_decay_factor` for the class `DDPG` that updates the delta decay factor based on the number of training episodes. The function adjusts the decay factor according to specific calibrated values for episodes below 1000, a linear interpolation for episodes between 1000 and 3000, and sets a constant decay factor for episodes beyond 3000. The function raises an assertion error if the number of training episodes is less than or equal to zero.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass DDPG:\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.delta_decay = None  # Initialize the delta decay factor\n        pass\n\n    def update_delta_decay_factor(self, num_train_episode):\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
