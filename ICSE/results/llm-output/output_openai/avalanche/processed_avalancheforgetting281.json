    "result": "To create the `forgetting` function, we need to calculate the forgetting for each experience over time. The forgetting for an experience is defined as the difference between the accuracy at the time the experience was learned and the current accuracy. If the current time is before the experience was learned, the forgetting is set to zero.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef forgetting(accuracy_matrix, boundary_indices=None):\n    # Determine the number of time steps and experiences\n    num_time_steps, num_experiences = accuracy_matrix.shape\n    \n    # If boundary_indices is not provided, assume it ranges from 0 to num_experiences\n    if boundary_indices is None:\n        boundary_indices = list(range(num_experiences))\n    \n    # Initialize the forgetting matrix with zeros\n    forgetting_matrix = np.zeros_like(accuracy_matrix)\n    \n    # Calculate forgetting for each experience\n    for exp_idx in range(num_experiences):\n        # Determine the time step when the experience was learned\n        learn_time = boundary_indices[exp_idx]\n        \n        # Calculate forgetting for each time step\n        for time_idx in range(num_time_steps):\n            if time_idx >= learn_time:\n                # Calculate forgetting as the difference between the learned accuracy and current accuracy\n                forgetting_matrix[time_idx, exp_idx] = accuracy_matrix[learn_time, exp_idx] - accuracy_matrix[time_idx, exp_idx]\n            else:\n                # Set forgetting to zero before the experience is learned\n                forgetting_matrix[time_idx, exp_idx] = 0\n    \n    return forgetting_matrix\n\n# Example usage:\n# accuracy_matrix = np.array([[0.8, 0.7], [0.85, 0.75], [0.9, 0.8]])\n# boundary_indices = [0, 1]\n# print(forgetting(accuracy_matrix, boundary_indices))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Inputs**:\n   - `accuracy_matrix`: A 2D numpy array with shape `<time, experiences>`.\n   - `boundary_indices`: An optional list indicating the time step when each experience was learned. If not provided, it defaults to a list ranging from 0 to the number of experiences.\n\n2. **Initialization**:\n   - We initialize a `forgetting_matrix` with the same shape as `accuracy_matrix`, filled with zeros.\n\n3. **Forgetting Calculation**:\n   - For each experience, we determine the time step when it was learned using `boundary_indices`.\n   - For each time step, if the current time is greater than or equal to the learning time, we calculate forgetting as the difference between the accuracy at the learning time and the current accuracy.\n   - If the current time is before the learning time, forgetting is set to zero.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - The function returns the `forgetting_matrix`, which contains the forgetting values for each experience over time.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called forgetting that calculates forgetting based on an accuracy matrix and boundary indices. The function takes in a 2D accuracy matrix with shape <time, experiences> and an optional list of boundary indices. If boundary_indices is not provided, it is assumed to be a list ranging from 0 to the number of experiences in the accuracy matrix. \n\nThe forgetting calculation is done by subtracting the accuracy at the time the experience was learned from the current accuracy for each experience. Forgetting is set to zero before learning on the experience. The function returns a forgetting matrix with the same shape as the input accuracy matrix.",
