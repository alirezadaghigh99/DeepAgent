    "result": "To implement the `_create_pytorch_loss` function that calculates the sigmoid cross-entropy loss using PyTorch, you can utilize the `torch.nn.functional.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits` function. This function combines a sigmoid layer and the binary cross-entropy loss in a single function, which is numerically more stable than using a plain sigmoid followed by a binary cross-entropy loss.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `_create_pytorch_loss` method within the `SigmoidCrossEntropy` class:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom torch.nn import Module\n\nclass SigmoidCrossEntropy(Module):\n    def _create_pytorch_loss(self, logits, labels):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the sigmoid cross-entropy loss between logits and labels.\n\n        Args:\n            logits (torch.Tensor): The input logits with shape (batch_size) or (batch_size, tasks).\n            labels (torch.Tensor): The target labels with the same shape as logits.\n\n        Returns:\n            torch.Tensor: The calculated loss.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Ensure the labels are of the same type as logits\n        labels = labels.type_as(logits)\n        \n        # Calculate the sigmoid cross-entropy loss\n        loss = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits, labels, reduction='none')\n        \n        return loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Imports**: We import necessary modules from PyTorch, including `torch` and `torch.nn.functional`.\n- **Class Definition**: The `SigmoidCrossEntropy` class inherits from `torch.nn.Module`, which is a base class for all neural network modules in PyTorch.\n- **Method `_create_pytorch_loss`**:\n  - **Arguments**: It takes `logits` and `labels` as input, both of which are PyTorch tensors.\n  - **Type Conversion**: The labels are converted to the same data type as the logits to ensure compatibility.\n  - **Loss Calculation**: The `binary_cross_entropy_with_logits` function is used to compute the loss. This function applies the sigmoid function to the logits and then computes the binary cross-entropy loss.\n  - **Reduction**: The `reduction='none'` argument ensures that the loss is computed for each element individually, returning a tensor of the same shape as the input.\n\nThis implementation will correctly compute the sigmoid cross-entropy loss for each element in the input tensors, which can be useful for multi-task learning scenarios where you might want to handle each task's loss separately.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called `_create_pytorch_loss` that calculates the sigmoid cross entropy loss between output logits and labels using PyTorch. The inputs are tensors of logits and labels with shapes `(batch_size)` or `(batch_size, tasks)`, and the output is a tensor of loss values.\n\n```python\nclass SigmoidCrossEntropy(Loss):\n    def _create_pytorch_loss(self):\n```",
