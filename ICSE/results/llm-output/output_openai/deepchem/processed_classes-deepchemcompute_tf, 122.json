    "result": "To implement the `_compute_tf_loss` function that calculates the sigmoid cross-entropy loss using TensorFlow, you can utilize the `tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits` function. This function is designed to compute the sigmoid cross-entropy loss between logits and labels efficiently. Here's how you can implement the `_compute_tf_loss` method within the `SigmoidCrossEntropy` class:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.losses import Loss\n\nclass SigmoidCrossEntropy(Loss):\n    def _compute_tf_loss(self, output, labels):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the sigmoid cross-entropy loss between logits and labels.\n\n        Args:\n            output (tf.Tensor): The logits tensor with shape (batch_size,) or (batch_size, tasks).\n            labels (tf.Tensor): The labels tensor with the same shape as output.\n\n        Returns:\n            tf.Tensor: A tensor of loss values with shape (batch_size,) or (batch_size, tasks).\n        \"\"\"\n        # Compute the sigmoid cross-entropy loss\n        loss = tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=output)\n        \n        # Return the loss\n        return loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Inputs**: The function takes two arguments, `output` and `labels`, which are both tensors. These tensors can have shapes `(batch_size,)` or `(batch_size, tasks)`, where `tasks` represents the number of tasks or classes for multi-task learning.\n\n- **Sigmoid Cross-Entropy Loss**: The function uses `tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits`, which computes the sigmoid cross-entropy loss. This function expects logits (raw prediction scores) and labels (ground truth values) as inputs.\n\n- **Output**: The function returns a tensor of loss values with the same shape as the input tensors, representing the loss for each instance in the batch.\n\nThis implementation is efficient and leverages TensorFlow's built-in operations to ensure compatibility and performance.",
