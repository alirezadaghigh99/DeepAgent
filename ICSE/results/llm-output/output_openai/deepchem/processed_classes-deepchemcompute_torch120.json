    "result": "To create a function that calculates the categorical cross-entropy loss using PyTorch, we can utilize the `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy` function. This function is well-suited for handling both 2D and 3D input tensors, which correspond to the shapes `(batch_size, classes)` and `(batch_size, tasks, classes)`, respectively.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `_create_pytorch_loss` method within the `CategoricalCrossEntropy` class:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom torch.nn import Module\n\nclass CategoricalCrossEntropy(Module):\n    def _create_pytorch_loss(self, probabilities, labels):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the categorical cross-entropy loss between output probabilities and labels.\n\n        Args:\n            probabilities (torch.Tensor): The predicted probabilities with shape (batch_size, classes)\n                                          or (batch_size, tasks, classes).\n            labels (torch.Tensor): The true labels with the same shape as probabilities.\n\n        Returns:\n            torch.Tensor: The calculated loss.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Check if the input is 3D (batch_size, tasks, classes)\n        if probabilities.dim() == 3:\n            # Reshape to (batch_size * tasks, classes) for cross-entropy calculation\n            batch_size, tasks, classes = probabilities.shape\n            probabilities = probabilities.view(batch_size * tasks, classes)\n            labels = labels.view(batch_size * tasks, classes)\n        \n        # Calculate the cross-entropy loss\n        # Note: F.cross_entropy expects class indices, so we use torch.argmax to get them\n        loss = F.cross_entropy(probabilities, torch.argmax(labels, dim=-1))\n        \n        return loss\n\n# Example usage:\n# cce = CategoricalCrossEntropy()\n# loss = cce._create_pytorch_loss(probabilities, labels)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Dimensions**: The function first checks if the input tensor is 3D. If so, it reshapes the tensors to 2D to facilitate the use of `F.cross_entropy`, which expects 2D inputs.\n\n2. **Cross-Entropy Calculation**: The `F.cross_entropy` function is used to compute the loss. It requires the target labels to be class indices, so we use `torch.argmax` to convert one-hot encoded labels to indices.\n\n3. **Output**: The function returns the computed loss as a tensor.\n\nThis implementation handles both 2D and 3D input shapes, making it versatile for different use cases.",
