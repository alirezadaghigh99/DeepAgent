    "result": "To implement the `_compute_tf_loss` function for calculating the softmax cross-entropy loss using TensorFlow, you can utilize the `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` function. This function computes the softmax cross-entropy loss between the logits and the labels. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.losses import Loss\n\nclass SoftmaxCrossEntropy(Loss):\n    def _compute_tf_loss(self, output, labels):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the softmax cross-entropy loss between logits and labels.\n\n        Args:\n            output (tf.Tensor): The output logits with shape (batch_size, classes) or (batch_size, tasks, classes).\n            labels (tf.Tensor): The one-hot encoded labels with the same shape as output.\n\n        Returns:\n            tf.Tensor: A tensor of loss values.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Ensure the labels are in the same shape as the output\n        labels = tf.cast(labels, dtype=output.dtype)\n\n        # Compute the softmax cross-entropy loss\n        if len(output.shape) == 2:\n            # Case when shape is (batch_size, classes)\n            loss = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=output)\n        elif len(output.shape) == 3:\n            # Case when shape is (batch_size, tasks, classes)\n            # Reshape to combine batch_size and tasks for computation\n            batch_size, tasks, classes = output.shape\n            output_reshaped = tf.reshape(output, [-1, classes])\n            labels_reshaped = tf.reshape(labels, [-1, classes])\n            loss = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels_reshaped, logits=output_reshaped)\n            # Reshape back to (batch_size, tasks)\n            loss = tf.reshape(loss, [batch_size, tasks])\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Output and labels must have shape (batch_size, classes) or (batch_size, tasks, classes)\")\n\n        return loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Shapes**: The function handles two possible input shapes: `(batch_size, classes)` and `(batch_size, tasks, classes)`.\n- **Label Casting**: The labels are cast to the same data type as the output logits to ensure compatibility.\n- **Loss Calculation**:\n  - For 2D inputs `(batch_size, classes)`, the loss is computed directly.\n  - For 3D inputs `(batch_size, tasks, classes)`, the tensors are reshaped to 2D to compute the loss, and then reshaped back to the original dimensions.\n- **Error Handling**: An error is raised if the input shapes do not match the expected dimensions.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the function can handle both 2D and 3D input shapes, making it versatile for different use cases.",
