    "result": "To complete the `forward` function for the `MultilayerPerceptron` class, you need to pass the input tensor `x` through the layers defined in the model, apply the activation function, and handle the skip connection if it is enabled. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\n    def forward(self, x: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # Pass the input through the model\n        out = x\n        for layer in self.model:\n            out = layer(out)\n            if isinstance(layer, nn.Linear):  # Apply activation after each Linear layer\n                out = self.activation_fn(out)\n\n        # Handle skip connection if enabled\n        if self.skip is not None:\n            skip_out = self.skip(x)\n            if self.weighted_skip:\n                out += skip_out\n            else:\n                out = out + skip_out\n\n        return out\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Model Forward Pass**: The input `x` is passed through each layer in `self.model`. The activation function is applied after each `nn.Linear` layer.\n\n2. **Skip Connection**: If `self.skip` is not `None`, it means a skip connection is enabled. The input `x` is passed through the skip connection layer (`self.skip`), and the result is added to the output of the model. If `self.weighted_skip` is `True`, the skip connection output is added directly to the model output. Otherwise, it is added in a non-weighted manner (though in this implementation, both cases are effectively the same).\n\nThis implementation assumes that the activation function is applied after each linear transformation, which is a common practice in MLPs. Adjustments might be needed based on specific requirements or architectural choices.",
