    "result": "To create a PyTorch loss function for calculating the mean squared error (MSE) loss without reduction, you can define the `_create_pytorch_loss` method within the `L2Loss` class. This method will ensure that the shapes of `output` and `labels` are consistent before computing the MSE loss. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass Loss:\n    # Assuming there is a base class named Loss\n    pass\n\nclass L2Loss(Loss):\n    def _create_pytorch_loss(self):\n        def mse_loss(output, labels):\n            # Ensure the shapes of output and labels are consistent\n            if output.shape != labels.shape:\n                raise ValueError(f\"Shape mismatch: output shape {output.shape} and labels shape {labels.shape} must be the same.\")\n            \n            # Compute the MSE loss without reduction\n            loss = (output - labels) ** 2\n            return loss\n        \n        return mse_loss\n\n# Example usage:\n# l2_loss = L2Loss()\n# loss_fn = l2_loss._create_pytorch_loss()\n# output = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\n# labels = torch.tensor([1.5, 2.5, 3.5])\n# loss = loss_fn(output, labels)\n# print(loss)  # Output: tensor([0.2500, 0.2500, 0.2500])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Class Structure**: The `L2Loss` class inherits from a base class `Loss`. The `_create_pytorch_loss` method is defined within `L2Loss`.\n\n2. **Shape Consistency Check**: Before computing the loss, the method checks if the shapes of `output` and `labels` are the same. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n3. **MSE Loss Calculation**: The mean squared error is calculated as the element-wise square of the difference between `output` and `labels`. The result is returned without any reduction (i.e., no mean or sum is applied).\n\n4. **Usage**: The method returns a function `mse_loss` that can be used to compute the loss given `output` and `labels`.",
