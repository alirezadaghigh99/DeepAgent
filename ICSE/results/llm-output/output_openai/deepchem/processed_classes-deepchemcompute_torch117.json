    "result": "To implement the `_compute_pytorch_loss` function for calculating the softmax cross entropy loss using PyTorch, we need to handle both possible input shapes: `(batch_size, classes)` and `(batch_size, tasks, classes)`. The function will use PyTorch's `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`, which combines `nn.LogSoftmax` and `nn.NLLLoss` in one single class. This function expects the input to be raw logits and the labels to be class indices.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `_compute_pytorch_loss` function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass SoftmaxCrossEntropy:\n    def _compute_pytorch_loss(self, output, labels):\n        # Determine if the input is 2D or 3D\n        if output.dim() == 2:\n            # Case: (batch_size, classes)\n            loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\n            loss = loss_fn(output, labels)\n        elif output.dim() == 3:\n            # Case: (batch_size, tasks, classes)\n            # Reshape to (batch_size * tasks, classes) and (batch_size * tasks)\n            batch_size, tasks, classes = output.shape\n            output = output.view(batch_size * tasks, classes)\n            labels = labels.view(batch_size * tasks)\n            loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\n            loss = loss_fn(output, labels)\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Output tensor must be 2D or 3D\")\n\n        return loss\n\n# Example usage:\n# output = torch.randn(5, 10)  # Example logits for (batch_size, classes)\n# labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (5,))  # Example labels for (batch_size,)\n# loss = SoftmaxCrossEntropy()._compute_pytorch_loss(output, labels)\n# print(loss)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **2D Input (batch_size, classes):** Directly apply `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` to compute the loss.\n- **3D Input (batch_size, tasks, classes):** Reshape the output and labels to treat each task as a separate instance. This involves flattening the first two dimensions into one, so the loss function can process them as a batch of instances.\n- **Error Handling:** Raise an error if the input tensor is not 2D or 3D, as these are the only supported shapes in this context.\n\nThis function will compute the cross-entropy loss for each instance in the batch, whether it's a single task or multiple tasks per instance.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called `_compute_pytorch_loss` that calculates the softmax cross entropy loss between output logits and labels using PyTorch.
