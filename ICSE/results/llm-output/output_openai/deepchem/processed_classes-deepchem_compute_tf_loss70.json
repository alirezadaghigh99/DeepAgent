    "result": "To create the `_compute_tf_loss` function for the `L2Loss` class, we need to ensure that the `output` and `labels` tensors are of the same shape and are of float type. Then, we can compute the L2 loss, which is essentially the mean of the squared differences between the `output` and `labels`.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python using TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nclass Loss:\n    # Base class for losses, potentially with other methods and attributes\n    pass\n\nclass L2Loss(Loss):\n    def _compute_tf_loss(self, output, labels):\n        # Ensure the output and labels are of the same shape\n        tf.debugging.assert_shapes([(output, labels.shape)], message=\"Output and labels must have the same shape.\")\n        \n        # Ensure the output and labels are of float type\n        output = tf.cast(output, tf.float32)\n        labels = tf.cast(labels, tf.float32)\n        \n        # Compute the squared differences\n        squared_difference = tf.square(output - labels)\n        \n        # Compute the mean of the squared differences\n        loss = tf.reduce_mean(squared_difference)\n        \n        return loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Shape Consistency**: We use `tf.debugging.assert_shapes` to ensure that the `output` and `labels` tensors have the same shape. This is crucial for element-wise operations.\n\n2. **Type Casting**: We cast both `output` and `labels` to `tf.float32` to ensure they are of float type, which is necessary for the L2 loss calculation.\n\n3. **Squared Differences**: We calculate the squared differences between `output` and `labels` using `tf.square(output - labels)`.\n\n4. **Mean Calculation**: Finally, we compute the mean of these squared differences using `tf.reduce_mean`, which gives us the L2 loss.\n\nThis function will return the L2 loss as a single scalar value, which is the mean of the squared differences between the `output` and `labels`.",
