    "result": "To implement the `losses` function for the `RBM` class, we need to calculate the contrastive divergence. This involves computing the free energy of the visible units clamped on the data (`vv`) and the free energy of the model's visible units after Gibbs sampling (`self.v_k`). The contrastive divergence is the difference between these two free energy values.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `losses` function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\nclass RBM:\n    def __init__(self, possible_ratings, visible_units, hidden_units=500, keep_prob=0.7, init_stdv=0.1, learning_rate=0.004, minibatch_size=100, training_epoch=20, display_epoch=10, sampling_protocol=[50, 70, 80, 90, 100], debug=False, with_metrics=False, seed=42):\n        self.v_k = None  # visible units at step k after Gibbs sampling\n        # Initialize other parameters as needed\n        pass\n\n    def free_energy(self, x):\n        # This method should compute the free energy of the visible units given the hidden units\n        # For demonstration purposes, let's assume it returns a tensor\n        # Replace this with the actual implementation\n        return torch.sum(x, dim=1)  # Dummy implementation\n\n    def losses(self, vv):\n        # Calculate the free energy of the data\n        free_energy_data = self.free_energy(vv)\n        \n        # Calculate the free energy of the model's visible units after Gibbs sampling\n        free_energy_model = self.free_energy(self.v_k)\n        \n        # Calculate the contrastive divergence\n        contrastive_divergence = free_energy_data - free_energy_model\n        \n        # Return the contrastive divergence as a tensor\n        return contrastive_divergence\n\n# Example usage:\n# rbm = RBM(possible_ratings=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], visible_units=100)\n# vv = torch.tensor([[1.0, 0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]])  # Example data\n# rbm.v_k = torch.tensor([[0.5, 0.5, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]])  # Example Gibbs sampled data\n# loss = rbm.losses(vv)\n# print(loss)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`free_energy` Method**: This method should compute the free energy of the visible units. The actual implementation will depend on the specific architecture and parameters of your RBM. The dummy implementation here simply sums the input tensor along the specified dimension.\n  \n- **`losses` Method**:\n  - It calculates the free energy of the input data `vv` using the `free_energy` method.\n  - It calculates the free energy of the model's visible units after Gibbs sampling, stored in `self.v_k`.\n  - The contrastive divergence is computed as the difference between the free energy of the data and the free energy of the model.\n  - The result is returned as a tensor.\n\nMake sure to replace the dummy implementation of `free_energy` with the actual computation based on your RBM's architecture.",
