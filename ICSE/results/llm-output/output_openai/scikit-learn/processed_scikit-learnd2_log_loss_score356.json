    "result": "To calculate the D\u00b2 score, which is the fraction of log loss explained, we need to compare the log loss of the model's predictions with the log loss of a naive model that always predicts the class proportions of the true labels.

Adjustments may be needed based on the specific format of your data.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called d2_log_loss_score that calculates the D^2 score, which is the fraction of log loss explained. The function takes in the following parameters:\n\n- y_true: array-like or label indicator matrix, representing the actual labels for the samples.\n- y_pred: array-like of shape (n_samples, n_classes) or (n_samples,), representing the predicted probabilities from a classifier.\n- sample_weight: array-like of shape (n_samples,), representing sample weights.\n- labels: array-like, representing the labels. If not provided, they will be inferred from y_true.\n\nThe function returns the D^2 score as a float or ndarray of floats. It may be negative and is not well-defined for a single sample. The best possible score is 1.0, and a model that always predicts the per-class proportions of y_true gets a score of 0.0. The function also handles cases where the number of samples is less than two, returning a NaN value in such cases.if _num_samples(y_pred) < 2:\n        msg = \"D^2 score is not well-defined with less than two samples.\"\n        warnings.warn(msg, UndefinedMetricWarning)\n        return float(\"nan\")",
