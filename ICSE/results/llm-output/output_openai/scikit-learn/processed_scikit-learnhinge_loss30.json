    "result": "To implement the `hinge_loss` function, we need to handle both binary and multiclass classification scenarios. The hinge loss for binary classification is defined as:\n\n\\[ \\text{hinge\\_loss} = \\max(0, 1 - y_{\\text{true}} \\cdot \\text{pred\\_decision}) \\]\n\nFor multiclass classification, the hinge loss can be calculated using the \"one-vs-all\" approach, where the loss is computed for each class separately and then averaged.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `hinge_loss` function in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef hinge_loss(y_true, pred_decision, labels=None, sample_weight=None):\n    # Convert inputs to numpy arrays for efficient computation\n    y_true = np.asarray(y_true)\n    pred_decision = np.asarray(pred_decision)\n    \n    # Check if sample_weight is provided, otherwise set to 1 for all samples\n    if sample_weight is None:\n        sample_weight = np.ones_like(y_true, dtype=float)\n    else:\n        sample_weight = np.asarray(sample_weight)\n    \n    # Determine if the task is binary or multiclass\n    unique_labels = np.unique(y_true)\n    \n    if labels is None:\n        labels = unique_labels\n    else:\n        labels = np.asarray(labels)\n    \n    if len(labels) == 2:\n        # Binary classification\n        # Ensure labels are +1 and -1\n        if set(labels) != {1, -1}:\n            raise ValueError(\"For binary classification, labels must be +1 and -1.\")\n        \n        # Calculate hinge loss for binary classification\n        losses = np.maximum(0, 1 - y_true * pred_decision)\n    else:\n        # Multiclass classification\n        # One-vs-all approach\n        losses = []\n        for label in labels:\n            # Create binary targets for the current class\n            y_binary = np.where(y_true == label, 1, -1)\n            # Calculate hinge loss for the current class\n            loss = np.maximum(0, 1 - y_binary * pred_decision[:, label])\n            losses.append(loss)\n        \n        # Average the losses across all classes\n        losses = np.mean(losses, axis=0)\n    \n    # Apply sample weights\n    weighted_losses = sample_weight * losses\n    \n    # Return the average hinge loss\n    return np.mean(weighted_losses)\n\n# Example usage:\n# y_true = np.array([1, -1, 1, -1])\n# pred_decision = np.array([0.8, -0.5, 0.3, -0.2])\n# print(hinge_loss(y_true, pred_decision))\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Binary Classification**: The function checks if the labels are +1 and -1, and computes the hinge loss using the formula for binary classification.\n- **Multiclass Classification**: The function uses a one-vs-all approach, where it computes the hinge loss for each class separately and averages the results.\n- **Sample Weights**: If provided, sample weights are applied to the losses before averaging.\n- **Error Handling**: The function raises an error if the labels for binary classification are not +1 and -1.\n\nThis implementation efficiently handles both binary and multiclass classification tasks using NumPy for vectorized operations.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called hinge_loss that calculates the average hinge loss for binary or multiclass classification tasks. The function takes in the following parameters:\n\n- y_true: an array-like object containing the true target values, encoded as integers (+1 and -1 for binary classification).\n- pred_decision: an array-like object containing the predicted decision values.\n- labels: an optional array-like object containing all the labels for multiclass hinge loss.\n- sample_weight: an optional array-like object containing sample weights.\n\nThe function returns the average hinge loss as a float value. The hinge loss is calculated based on the margin between the true and predicted values, and it serves as an upper bound for the number of classification mistakes made by the classifier.\n\nThe function handles both binary and multiclass cases, applying different calculations based on the number of unique labels present in the target values. The implementation includes error handling for different scenarios and utilizes NumPy functions for efficient computation.",
