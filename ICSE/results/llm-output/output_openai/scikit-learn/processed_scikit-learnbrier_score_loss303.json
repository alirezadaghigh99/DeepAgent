    "result": "The `brier_score_loss` function is a useful tool for evaluating the accuracy of probabilistic predictions in binary classification tasks. Here's a breakdown of its key features and how it works:\n\n### Key Features:\n\n1. **Binary Classification**: The function is specifically designed for binary classification problems, where the target variable has two possible outcomes.\n\n2. **Mean Squared Difference**: It calculates the mean squared difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual binary outcomes. This provides a measure of how well the predicted probabilities align with the true outcomes.\n\n3. **Input Parameters**:\n   - `y_true`: The true binary labels. These should be in a format that represents the two classes, such as 0 and 1.\n   - `y_proba`: The predicted probabilities for the positive class. These should be values between 0 and 1.\n   - `sample_weight` (optional): Weights for each sample. This allows for weighted averaging of the Brier score.\n   - `pos_label` (optional): Specifies which label is considered the positive class. This is useful when the positive class is not labeled as 1.\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - **Deprecated Parameters**: The function includes checks to ensure that any deprecated parameters are not used, providing clear error messages if they are.\n   - **Input Type Checking**: It verifies that the inputs are of the correct type and format, raising errors if they are not.\n   - **Label Consistency**: Ensures that the labels in `y_true` are consistent with a binary classification task.\n   - **Probability Range**: Checks that all values in `y_proba` are within the [0, 1] range, raising an error if any values fall outside this range.\n\n5. **Output**:\n   - The function returns a float representing the Brier score loss. A lower Brier score indicates better accuracy of the predicted probabilities.\n\n### Usage Example:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.metrics import brier_score_loss\n\n# True binary labels\ny_true = [0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n# Predicted probabilities for the positive class\ny_proba = [0.1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.2]\n\n# Calculate Brier score loss\nbrier_score = brier_score_loss(y_true, y_proba)\n\nprint(f\"Brier Score Loss: {brier_score}\")\n```\n\n### Interpretation:\n\n- **Brier Score Range**: The Brier score ranges from 0 to 1. A score of 0 indicates perfect predictions, while a score of 1 indicates the worst possible predictions.\n- **Use Cases**: The Brier score is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to assess the calibration of predicted probabilities, such as in weather forecasting or medical diagnosis.\n\nBy using the `brier_score_loss` function, you can effectively evaluate the quality of your probabilistic predictions and make informed decisions about model performance and improvements.",
    "prompt": "The `brier_score_loss` function calculates the Brier score loss, which measures the mean squared difference between predicted probabilities and actual binary outcomes. The function supports binary classification and includes error handling for deprecated parameters, input type checking, and label consistency. Inputs include the true labels (`y_true`), predicted probabilities (`y_proba`), optional sample weights, and a parameter to define the positive class label (`pos_label`). The output is a float representing the Brier score loss. Errors are raised for incorrect input types, non-binary classification targets, and probability values outside the [0, 1] range.",
