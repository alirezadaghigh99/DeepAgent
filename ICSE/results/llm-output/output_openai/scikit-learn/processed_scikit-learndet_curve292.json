    "result": "To create the `det_curve` function, we need to compute the false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR) for various thresholds based on the predicted scores. This involves iterating over possible thresholds and calculating the rates at each threshold. Here's how you can implement this function in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.utils import check_consistent_length\nfrom sklearn.utils.multiclass import type_of_target\n\ndef det_curve(y_true, y_score, pos_label=None, sample_weight=None):\n    # Check that the input arrays have consistent lengths\n    check_consistent_length(y_true, y_score, sample_weight)\n    \n    # Determine the positive label if not provided\n    if pos_label is None:\n        pos_label = 1 if type_of_target(y_true) == 'binary' else y_true.max()\n    \n    # Convert y_true to a boolean array where True indicates the positive class\n    y_true = np.array(y_true == pos_label, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Sort scores and corresponding true values in descending order\n    desc_score_indices = np.argsort(y_score, kind=\"mergesort\")[::-1]\n    y_score = y_score[desc_score_indices]\n    y_true = y_true[desc_score_indices]\n    \n    # If sample weights are provided, sort them as well\n    if sample_weight is not None:\n        sample_weight = np.array(sample_weight)[desc_score_indices]\n    else:\n        sample_weight = np.ones_like(y_true)\n    \n    # Calculate the distinct score thresholds\n    distinct_value_indices = np.where(np.diff(y_score))[0]\n    threshold_idxs = np.r_[distinct_value_indices, y_true.size - 1]\n    \n    # Initialize true positive and false positive counts\n    tps = np.cumsum(y_true * sample_weight)[threshold_idxs]\n    fps = np.cumsum((1 - y_true) * sample_weight)[threshold_idxs]\n    \n    # Total number of positive and negative samples\n    tps_total = tps[-1]\n    fps_total = fps[-1]\n    \n    # Calculate false negative and false positive rates\n    fnr = (tps_total - tps) / tps_total\n    fpr = fps / (fps_total + np.finfo(float).eps)\n    \n    # Extract thresholds\n    thresholds = y_score[threshold_idxs]\n    \n    return fpr, fnr, thresholds\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    y_true = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])\n    y_score = np.array([0.1, 0.4, 0.35, 0.8])\n    fpr, fnr, thresholds = det_curve(y_true, y_score, pos_label=1)\n    \n    print(\"False Positive Rates:\", fpr)\n    print(\"False Negative Rates:\", fnr)\n    print(\"Thresholds:\", thresholds)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: We first ensure that the input arrays have consistent lengths using `check_consistent_length`.\n\n2. **Positive Label Handling**: If `pos_label` is not provided, we assume the positive class is `1` for binary tasks or the maximum value in `y_true`.\n\n3. **Sorting**: We sort the scores in descending order and rearrange `y_true` and `sample_weight` accordingly.\n\n4. **Threshold Calculation**: We identify distinct score values to use as thresholds.\n\n5. **Cumulative Sums**: We compute cumulative sums of true positives and false positives to calculate FPR and FNR.\n\n6. **Rate Calculation**: FPR and FNR are calculated based on the cumulative sums and total counts.\n\n7. **Return Values**: The function returns the FPR, FNR, and the thresholds used.\n\nThis function can be used to evaluate the trade-offs between false positives and false negatives at different decision thresholds in binary classification tasks.",
