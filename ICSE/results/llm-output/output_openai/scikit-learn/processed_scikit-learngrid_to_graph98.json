    "result": "To create a function that returns a graph of pixel-to-pixel connections, we can use a sparse matrix to efficiently represent the adjacency matrix of the graph. The adjacency matrix will have non-zero entries where there is a connection between two voxels (pixels in 3D). We will consider 6-connectivity for 3D (each voxel is connected to its immediate neighbors along the x, y, and z axes).\n\nHere's a Python function that implements this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import sparse\n\ndef pixel_to_pixel_graph(n_x, n_y, n_z=1, mask=None, return_as=sparse.coo_matrix, dtype=int):\n    # Total number of voxels\n    n_voxels = n_x * n_y * n_z\n    \n    # Create a mask if none is provided\n    if mask is None:\n        mask = np.ones((n_x, n_y, n_z), dtype=bool)\n    \n    # Ensure the mask is a boolean array\n    mask = mask.astype(bool)\n    \n    # Get the indices of the voxels that are within the mask\n    indices = np.argwhere(mask)\n    \n    # List to store the edges\n    edges = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each voxel\n    for idx in indices:\n        x, y, z = idx\n        \n        # Check neighbors in 6-connectivity\n        for dx, dy, dz in [(-1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, -1, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, -1), (0, 0, 1)]:\n            nx, ny, nz = x + dx, y + dy, z + dz\n            \n            # Check if the neighbor is within bounds and within the mask\n            if 0 <= nx < n_x and 0 <= ny < n_y and 0 <= nz < n_z and mask[nx, ny, nz]:\n                # Calculate linear indices\n                current_index = x * n_y * n_z + y * n_z + z\n                neighbor_index = nx * n_y * n_z + ny * n_z + nz\n                \n                # Add the edge\n                edges.append((current_index, neighbor_index))\n    \n    # Convert edges to a numpy array\n    edges = np.array(edges)\n    \n    # Create the adjacency matrix\n    if return_as == np.ndarray:\n        graph = np.zeros((n_voxels, n_voxels), dtype=dtype)\n        for edge in edges:\n            graph[edge[0], edge[1]] = 1\n            graph[edge[1], edge[0]] = 1  # Since the graph is undirected\n    else:\n        graph = return_as((np.ones(len(edges), dtype=dtype), (edges[:, 0], edges[:, 1])), shape=(n_voxels, n_voxels))\n    \n    return graph\n\n# Example usage:\nn_x, n_y, n_z = 3, 3, 3\nmask = np.ones((n_x, n_y, n_z), dtype=bool)\ngraph = pixel_to_pixel_graph(n_x, n_y, n_z, mask=mask, return_as=sparse.coo_matrix)\nprint(graph)\n```\n\nThis function calculates the adjacency matrix for a 3D grid of voxels, considering only those voxels that are within the provided mask. The adjacency matrix can be returned as either a dense `np.ndarray` or a sparse matrix (default is `sparse.coo_matrix`). The function uses 6-connectivity, meaning each voxel is connected to its immediate neighbors along the x, y, and z axes.",
