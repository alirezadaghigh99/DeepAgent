It can be:\n        - A string representing the name of a scoring method available in scikit-learn.\n        - A callable that takes (estimator, X, y) as arguments and returns a score.\n        - None, in which case the function returns None.\n\n    Returns:\n    callable or None: A scorer object or None if the input is None.\n\n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If the input scoring value is not a valid string, callable, or None.\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n    >>> scorer = get_scorer('accuracy')\n    >>> print(scorer)\n    <function _passthrough_scorer at 0x...>\n\n    >>> custom_scorer = lambda estimator, X, y: accuracy_score(y, estimator.predict(X))\n    >>> scorer = get_scorer(custom_scorer)\n    >>> print(scorer)\n    <function <lambda> at 0x...>\n\n    >>> scorer = get_scorer(None)\n    >>> print(scorer)\n    None\n\n    >>> get_scorer(123)  # Raises ValueError\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(scoring, str):\n        try:\n            return deepcopy(sklearn_get_scorer(scoring))\n        except ValueError as e:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid scoring string: {scoring}\") from e\n    elif callable(scoring):\n        return scoring\n    elif scoring is None:\n        return None\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Scoring must be a string, callable, or None.\")\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n    scorer = get_scorer('accuracy')\n    print(scorer)\n\n    custom_scorer = lambda estimator, X, y: accuracy_score(y, estimator.predict(X))\n    scorer = get_scorer(custom_scorer)\n    print(scorer)\n\n    scorer = get_scorer(None)\n    print(scorer)\n\n    try:\n        get_scorer(123)\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **String Input**: If `scoring` is a string, the function attempts to retrieve a scorer using `sklearn.metrics.get_scorer`. It returns a deep copy of the scorer to ensure that the original scorer object is not modified.\n- **Callable Input**: If `scoring` is a callable, it is returned as is.\n- **None Input**: If `scoring` is `None`, the function returns `None`.\n- **Error Handling**: If `scoring` is neither a string, callable, nor `None`, a `ValueError` is raised.\n- **Docstring**: The docstring provides a detailed explanation of the function's parameters, return values, exceptions, and usage examples.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called get_scorer that takes a parameter called scoring. The function retrieves a scorer based on the input scoring method, which can be a string, a callable, or None. If the input is a string, the function returns a copy of the scorer object corresponding to that string. If the input is a callable, the function returns the input as is. If the input is None, the function returns None.\n\nThe function includes a docstring with information on how to use it, including examples. It also handles errors by raising a ValueError if the input scoring value is not valid.\n\nThe function returns the scorer object based on the input scoring method.",
