    "result": "To generate a mostly low-rank matrix with bell-shaped singular values, we can use a combination of random matrix generation and manipulation of singular values. The function `make_low_rank_matrix` will take parameters such as `n_samples`, `n_features`, `effective_rank`, `tail_strength`, and `random_state` to control the characteristics of the generated matrix. Here's how you can implement this function in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef make_low_rank_matrix(n_samples, n_features, effective_rank, tail_strength=0.1, random_state=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a mostly low-rank matrix with bell-shaped singular values.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - n_samples: int, number of samples (rows).\n    - n_features: int, number of features (columns).\n    - effective_rank: int, approximate rank of the matrix.\n    - tail_strength: float, between 0 and 1, the relative importance of the tail of the singular values.\n    - random_state: int or None, random seed for reproducibility.\n\n    Returns:\n    - X: ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_features), the generated low-rank matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if random_state is not None:\n        np.random.seed(random_state)\n\n    # Generate a random matrix\n    U, _ = np.linalg.qr(np.random.randn(n_samples, n_samples))\n    V, _ = np.linalg.qr(np.random.randn(n_features, n_features))\n\n    # Generate singular values with a bell-shaped profile\n    singular_values = np.exp(-np.linspace(0, 1, min(n_samples, n_features))**2 / (2 * (effective_rank / min(n_samples, n_features))**2))\n    \n    # Add tail strength\n    tail = tail_strength * np.random.rand(min(n_samples, n_features))\n    singular_values = (1 - tail_strength) * singular_values + tail\n\n    # Construct the low-rank matrix\n    S = np.zeros((n_samples, n_features))\n    np.fill_diagonal(S, singular_values)\n    X = U @ S @ V.T\n\n    return X\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n_samples = 100\n    n_features = 50\n    effective_rank = 10\n    tail_strength = 0.1\n    random_state = 42\n\n    X = make_low_rank_matrix(n_samples, n_features, effective_rank, tail_strength, random_state)\n    print(\"Generated matrix shape:\", X.shape)\n    print(\"First few rows of the matrix:\\n\", X[:5])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Random Matrix Generation**: We start by generating two random orthogonal matrices `U` and `V` using QR decomposition. These matrices help in constructing the low-rank matrix.\n- **Singular Values**: We create a bell-shaped profile for the singular values using an exponential decay function. The `effective_rank` parameter controls the spread of the bell shape.\n- **Tail Strength**: We add a small random component to the singular values to introduce some noise, controlled by the `tail_strength` parameter.\n- **Matrix Construction**: The low-rank matrix `X` is constructed by multiplying `U`, the diagonal matrix of singular values `S`, and the transpose of `V`.\n\nThis function provides a flexible way to generate matrices with specific low-rank characteristics, useful for testing algorithms that deal with dimensionality reduction or matrix factorization.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called make_low_rank_matrix that generates a mostly low rank matrix with bell-shaped singular values. The function takes in parameters such as n_samples, n_features, effective_rank, tail_strength, and random_state. It returns a matrix X of shape (n_samples, n_features) that represents the generated low rank matrix. The function utilizes random number generation for dataset creation and constructs the singular profile by combining signal and noise components based on the specified parameters. The function also includes examples of how to use it with sample input values.",
