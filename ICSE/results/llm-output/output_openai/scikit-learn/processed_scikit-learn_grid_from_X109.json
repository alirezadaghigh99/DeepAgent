    "result": "To create the `_grid_from_X` function, we need to generate a grid of points based on the percentiles of the dataset `X`. The function will handle both continuous and categorical features, and it will use the specified `grid_resolution` to determine the number of points for each feature. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef _grid_from_X(X, percentiles=(0.05, 0.95), is_categorical=None, grid_resolution=100):\n    X = np.asarray(X)\n    n_samples, n_features = X.shape\n    \n    if is_categorical is None:\n        is_categorical = [False] * n_features\n    \n    values = []\n    \n    for i in range(n_features):\n        if is_categorical[i]:\n            # If the feature is categorical, use unique values\n            unique_values = np.unique(X[:, i])\n            values.append(unique_values)\n        else:\n            # If the feature is continuous, use percentiles to determine the range\n            lower, upper = np.percentile(X[:, i], [percentiles[0] * 100, percentiles[1] * 100])\n            if grid_resolution > len(np.unique(X[:, i])):\n                # If grid_resolution is greater than the number of unique values, use unique values\n                unique_values = np.unique(X[:, i])\n                values.append(unique_values)\n            else:\n                # Generate grid_resolution equally spaced points between the percentiles\n                grid_values = np.linspace(lower, upper, grid_resolution)\n                values.append(grid_values)\n    \n    # Create the cartesian product of all the values\n    grid = np.array(list(product(*values)))\n    \n    return grid, values\n\n# Example usage:\n# X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])\n# grid, values = _grid_from_X(X, percentiles=(0.1, 0.9), is_categorical=[False, False], grid_resolution=10)\n# print(\"Grid:\\n\", grid)\n# print(\"Values:\\n\", values)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Parameters:**\n   - `X`: The input dataset, which is converted to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.\n   - `percentiles`: A tuple specifying the lower and upper percentiles to consider for continuous features.\n   - `is_categorical`: A list indicating whether each feature is categorical.\n   - `grid_resolution`: The number of points to generate for each feature if it is continuous.\n\n2. **Processing Each Feature:**\n   - For categorical features, we use the unique values directly.\n   - For continuous features, we calculate the specified percentiles and generate `grid_resolution` equally spaced points between these percentiles. If the number of unique values is less than `grid_resolution`, we use the unique values instead.\n\n3. **Cartesian Product:**\n   - We use `itertools.product` to create a cartesian product of the values for each feature, resulting in a grid of points.\n\n4. **Output:**\n   - `grid`: A NumPy array containing all combinations of feature values.\n   - `values`: A list of arrays, each containing the values used for the corresponding feature in the grid.\n\nThis function is flexible and can handle both categorical and continuous data, adjusting the grid points based on the characteristics of each feature.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called `_grid_from_X` that generates a grid of points based on the percentiles of a given dataset `X`. The function takes four parameters: `X` (array-like data), `percentiles` (tuple of float values), `is_categorical` (list of boolean values), and `grid_resolution` (integer). \n\nThe function calculates a grid by creating a cartesian product between the columns of `values`, where each column consists of `grid_resolution` equally-spaced points between the percentiles of the corresponding column in `X`. If `grid_resolution` is greater than the number of unique values in a column of `X` or if the feature is categorical (based on `is_categorical`), then the unique values will be used instead.\n\nThe function returns two outputs: `grid`, which is an ndarray containing a value for each feature at each point in the grid, and `values`, which is a list of 1d ndarrays representing the values used to create the grid. The size of each array in `values` is either `grid_resolution` or the number of unique values in the corresponding column of `X`, whichever is smaller.",
