    "result": "To generate a Python function called `cluster_qr` that finds the discrete partition closest to the eigenvector embedding, we can use the QR decomposition method. This method is often used in spectral clustering to find the closest orthogonal matrix to a given matrix, which helps in determining the cluster labels.\n\nHere's a step-by-step implementation of the `cluster_qr` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import qr\n\ndef cluster_qr(vectors):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the discrete partition closest to the eigenvector embedding using QR decomposition.\n\n    Parameters:\n    vectors (array-like): An array with shape (n_samples, n_clusters) representing the embedding space of the samples.\n\n    Returns:\n    labels (array): An array of integers with shape (n_samples,) representing the cluster labels of the vectors.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Perform QR decomposition on the input vectors\n    Q, R = qr(vectors)\n\n    # Find the index of the maximum value in each row of Q\n    labels = np.argmax(Q, axis=1)\n\n    return labels\n\n# Example usage:\n# vectors = np.array([[0.5, 0.5], [0.1, 0.9], [0.8, 0.2]])\n# labels = cluster_qr(vectors)\n# print(labels)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **QR Decomposition**: The function uses the QR decomposition to decompose the input `vectors` into an orthogonal matrix `Q` and an upper triangular matrix `R`. The orthogonal matrix `Q` is used to find the closest discrete partition.\n\n2. **Assigning Labels**: The function then assigns cluster labels by finding the index of the maximum value in each row of `Q`. This step effectively assigns each sample to the cluster corresponding to the largest component in its row of the orthogonal matrix.\n\n3. **Output**: The function returns an array of cluster labels, where each label corresponds to the cluster assignment of a sample.\n\nThis method is particularly useful in spectral clustering, where the goal is to partition data based on the eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian or a similar matrix. The QR decomposition helps in finding a discrete partition that is close to the continuous embedding provided by the eigenvectors.",
