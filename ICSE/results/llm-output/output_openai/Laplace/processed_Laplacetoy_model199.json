The input and output dimensions are specified by `in_dim` and `out_dim`.\n\n2. **Loss Function**: The loss function is chosen based on whether the task is regression or classification. For regression, Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used, and for classification, Cross-Entropy Loss is used.\n\n3. **Optimizer**: The Adam optimizer is used for training the model, with a learning rate of 0.001.\n\n4. **Training Loop**: If `fit` is `True`, the model is trained for the specified number of epochs (`n_epochs`). The training loop iterates over the data provided by `train_loader`, computes the loss, performs backpropagation, and updates the model parameters.\n\n5. **Output**: The function returns the trained model, which can be used for inference or further evaluation.\n\nThis function provides a basic framework for building and training a neural network using PyTorch, suitable for both regression and classification tasks.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function named `toy_model` that builds and optionally trains a simple neural network using PyTorch. The function receives a `DataLoader` for the training data, the number of epochs (`n_epochs`), input and output dimensions (`in_dim`, `out_dim`), and flags for whether to fit the model (`fit`) and whether it's a regression task (`regression`). If `fit` is `True`, the model is trained using either Mean Squared Error loss for regression or Cross-Entropy loss for classification, with an Adam optimizer. The function should return the trained `nn.Sequential` model. Inputs include `train_loader` (PyTorch DataLoader), `n_epochs` (default 500), `fit` (default True), `in_dim` and `out_dim` (default 1), and `regression` (default True), and the output is the trained PyTorch model.",
