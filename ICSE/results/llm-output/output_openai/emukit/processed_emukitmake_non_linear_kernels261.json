    "result": "To create a function `make_non_linear_kernels` that constructs a list of structured multi-fidelity kernels using a specified base kernel class from GPy, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Import the necessary components from GPy.\n2. Define the function with the specified parameters.\n3. Initialize the list of kernels.\n4. For the first fidelity, create a kernel using the base kernel class with the specified input dimensions and ARD setting.\n5. For each subsequent fidelity, construct a kernel by multiplying the base kernel applied to the current fidelity with the base kernel applied to the previous fidelity, and add another base kernel for bias.\n6.

    "prompt": "Write a Python function `make_non_linear_kernels` that constructs a list of structured multi-fidelity kernels using a specified base kernel class from GPy. The function should accept the following parameters: `base_kernel_class` (the GPy kernel class to use), `n_fidelities` (number of fidelity levels), `n_input_dims` (number of input dimensions), and `ARD` (a boolean indicating whether to use Automatic Relevance Determination, i.e., different lengthscales for different dimensions). The function should return a list of kernels, with one kernel per fidelity level, starting from the lowest to the highest fidelity. For the first fidelity, the kernel is simply the base kernel applied to the input dimensions. For subsequent fidelities, the kernel is constructed by multiplying the base kernel applied to the current fidelity with the base kernel applied to the previous fidelity, and adding another base kernel for bias. Default value of ARD is False",
