    "result": "To implement the `convert_xy_lists_to_arrays` function, we need to ensure that the input lists `x_list` and `y_list` are processed correctly. The function will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Check if the lengths of `x_list` and `y_list` are equal. If not, raise a `ValueError`.\n2. For each fidelity level, check if the number of points in `x_list[i]` matches the number of points in `y_list[i]`. If not, raise a `ValueError`.\n3. Construct the `x_array` by appending the fidelity index as the last column to each array in `x_list`.\n4. Construct the `y_array` by concatenating all arrays in `y_list`.\n5. Return the resulting `x_array` and `y_array` as a tuple.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef convert_xy_lists_to_arrays(x_list: List[np.ndarray], y_list: List[np.ndarray]) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:\n    # Check if the lengths of x_list and y_list are equal\n    if len(x_list) != len(y_list):\n        raise ValueError(\"x_list and y_list must have the same number of fidelity levels.\")\n    \n    # Initialize lists to hold the processed arrays\n    x_arrays = []\n    y_arrays = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each fidelity level\n    for fidelity_index, (x, y) in enumerate(zip(x_list, y_list)):\n        # Check if the number of points in x and y are the same\n        if x.shape[0] != y.shape[0]:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Number of points in x_list[{fidelity_index}] and y_list[{fidelity_index}] must be the same.\")\n        \n        # Append the fidelity index as the last column to x\n        fidelity_column = np.full((x.shape[0], 1), fidelity_index)\n        x_with_fidelity = np.hstack((x, fidelity_column))\n        \n        # Add the processed arrays to the lists\n        x_arrays.append(x_with_fidelity)\n        y_arrays.append(y)\n    \n    # Concatenate all arrays across all fidelity levels\n    x_array = np.vstack(x_arrays)\n    y_array = np.vstack(y_arrays)\n    \n    return x_array, y_array\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Input Validation**: The function first checks if `x_list` and `y_list` have the same length. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n- **Fidelity Level Check**: For each pair of arrays `(x, y)` from `x_list` and `y_list`, it checks if they have the same number of rows (i.e., data points). If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n- **Appending Fidelity Index**: For each `x` array, a column filled with the current fidelity index is created and appended to `x`.\n- **Concatenation**: All processed `x` and `y` arrays are concatenated vertically to form the final `x_array` and `y_array`.\n- **Return**: The function returns a tuple containing `x_array` and `y_array`.\n\nThis function ensures that the data is correctly structured and validated before being returned, making it robust for further processing.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called convert_xy_lists_to_arrays that takes in two input parameters: x_list and y_list, both of type List. The function returns a Tuple containing two numpy arrays: x_array and y_array. \n\nThe x_list parameter is a list of numpy arrays representing inputs, ordered from lowest to highest fidelity. The y_list parameter is a list of numpy arrays representing outputs, also ordered from lowest to highest fidelity. \n\nThe function first checks if the lengths of x_list and y_list are equal, raising a ValueError if they are not. It then checks if the number of points in each fidelity level is the same for both x_list and y_list, raising a ValueError if they are not. \n\nThe x_array returned contains all inputs across all fidelities with the fidelity index appended as the last column. The y_array returned contains all outputs across all fidelities. \n\nIf the function encounters any errors during the conversion process, it will raise appropriate ValueErrors.",
