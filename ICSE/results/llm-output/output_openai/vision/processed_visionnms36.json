    "result": "To implement the `nms` function using PyTorch and its `torchvision` library, we need to ensure that the necessary operations are available and then perform non-maximum suppression (NMS) on the bounding boxes. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torchvision.ops import nms as torchvision_nms\n\ndef nms(boxes, scores, iou_threshold):\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform non-maximum suppression (NMS) on bounding boxes.\n\n    Args:\n        boxes (Tensor): A tensor of shape [N, 4] representing bounding box coordinates in (x1, y1, x2, y2) format.\n        scores (Tensor): A tensor of shape [N] containing scores for each box.\n        iou_threshold (float): IoU threshold for suppression.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor: An int64 tensor containing the indices of the boxes that have been kept after NMS, sorted in decreasing order of scores.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if torchvision's nms function is available\n    if not hasattr(torchvision_nms, '__call__'):\n        raise RuntimeError(\"torchvision's nms function is not available. Please ensure you have torchvision installed.\")\n\n    # Log API usage\n    print(\"Using torchvision.ops.nms for non-maximum suppression.\")\n\n    # Perform NMS using torchvision's built-in function\n    keep_indices = torchvision_nms(boxes, scores, iou_threshold)\n\n    return keep_indices\n\n# Example usage:\n# boxes = torch.tensor([[10, 20, 30, 40], [12, 22, 32, 42], [50, 50, 70, 70]], dtype=torch.float32)\n# scores = torch.tensor([0.9, 0.85, 0.75], dtype=torch.float32)\n# iou_threshold = 0.5\n# kept_indices = nms(boxes, scores, iou_threshold)\n# print(kept_indices)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Imports**: We import `torch` for tensor operations and `torchvision.ops.nms` for the NMS operation.\n\n2. **Function Definition**: The `nms` function takes three arguments: `boxes`, `scores`, and `iou_threshold`.\n\n3. **Check for NMS Availability**: We check if the `nms` function from `torchvision.ops` is callable. If not, we raise an error indicating that `torchvision` needs to be installed.\n\n4. **Logging**: We log the usage of the `torchvision.ops.nms` function for transparency.\n\n5. **Perform NMS**: We call `torchvision_nms` with the provided `boxes`, `scores`, and `iou_threshold`. This function returns the indices of the boxes that are kept after applying NMS.\n\n6. **Return**: The function returns the indices of the boxes that have been kept, sorted in decreasing order of their scores.\n\nThis implementation leverages PyTorch's efficient NMS operation, ensuring that the function is both easy to use and performant.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called nms that performs non-maximum suppression (NMS) on a set of bounding boxes based on their intersection-over-union (IoU) values. The function takes three inputs: boxes (a Tensor of shape [N, 4] representing bounding box coordinates in (x1, y1, x2, y2) format), scores (a Tensor of shape [N] containing scores for each box), and iou_threshold (a float value specifying the IoU threshold for suppression).\n\nThe function iteratively removes lower scoring boxes that have an IoU greater than the specified threshold with another higher scoring box. The output is an int64 Tensor containing the indices of the boxes that have been kept after NMS, sorted in decreasing order of scores. Additionally, the function logs API usage and ensures that necessary operations are available before performing NMS using PyTorch's torchvision library.",
