    "result": "To convert bounding boxes from the (x, y, w, h) format to the (x1, y1, x2, y2) format, you can use a function that takes a tensor of bounding boxes as input and returns a tensor with the converted format. Here's how you can implement this function using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _box_xywh_to_xyxy(boxes):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert bounding boxes from (x, y, w, h) format to (x1, y1, x2, y2) format.\n\n    Args:\n        boxes (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (N, 4) where N is the number of boxes,\n                              and each box is represented as (x, y, w, h).\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: A tensor of shape (N, 4) with boxes in (x1, y1, x2, y2) format.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure the input is a tensor\n    if not isinstance(boxes, torch.Tensor):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input boxes should be a torch.Tensor\")\n\n    # Check if the input tensor has the correct shape\n    if boxes.ndimension() != 2 or boxes.size(1) != 4:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input boxes should have shape (N, 4)\")\n\n    # Extract x, y, w, h\n    x, y, w, h = boxes.unbind(dim=1)\n\n    # Calculate x1, y1, x2, y2\n    x1 = x\n    y1 = y\n    x2 = x + w\n    y2 = y + h\n\n    # Stack the results into a new tensor\n    converted_boxes = torch.stack((x1, y1, x2, y2), dim=1)\n\n    return converted_boxes\n\n# Example usage:\n# boxes_xywh = torch.tensor([[10, 20, 30, 40], [50, 60, 70, 80]])\n# boxes_xyxy = _box_xywh_to_xyxy(boxes_xywh)\n# print(boxes_xyxy)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the input is a tensor and if it has the correct shape `(N, 4)`.\n- **Unbinding**: The `unbind` function is used to split the tensor into separate components for `x`, `y`, `w`, and `h`.\n- **Conversion**: The bottom-right corner `(x2, y2)` is calculated by adding the width `w` to `x` and the height `h` to `y`.\n- **Stacking**: The `stack` function is used to combine the calculated coordinates into a new tensor with the desired format `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.\n\nThis function will efficiently convert a batch of bounding boxes from the `(x, y, w, h)` format to the `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` format using PyTorch operations.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function _box_xywh_to_xyxy that converts bounding boxes from the (x, y, w, h) format, where (x, y) represents the top-left corner and (w, h) represents the width and height, to the (x1, y1, x2, y2) format, where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) represent the top-left and bottom-right corners. The function should return a tensor with the converted bounding boxes.",
