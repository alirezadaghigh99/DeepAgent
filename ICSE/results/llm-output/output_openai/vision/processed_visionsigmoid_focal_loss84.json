    "result": "To implement the `sigmoid_focal_loss` function, we need to calculate the focal loss as described in the RetinaNet paper. The focal loss is designed to address the class imbalance in dense object detection tasks by down-weighting easy examples and focusing more on hard examples. The formula for the focal loss is:\n\n\\[ \\text{FL}(p_t) = -\\alpha_t (1 - p_t)^\\gamma \\log(p_t) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( p_t \\) is the model's estimated probability for each class.\n- \\(\\alpha_t\\) is the weighting factor for the class, which is \\(\\alpha\\) for the positive class and \\(1 - \\alpha\\) for the negative class.\n- \\(\\gamma\\) is the focusing parameter that reduces the loss contribution from easy examples and extends the range in which an example receives low loss.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef sigmoid_focal_loss(inputs, targets, alpha=0.25, gamma=2.0, reduction='none'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the focal loss between `inputs` and the ground truth `targets`.\n    \n    Args:\n        inputs (Tensor): Predictions for each example.\n        targets (Tensor): Ground truth binary labels (0 or 1) for each example.\n        alpha (float): Weighting factor for the positive class.\n        gamma (float): Focusing parameter to balance easy vs hard examples.\n        reduction (str): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output: 'none', 'mean', 'sum'.\n        \n    Returns:\n        Tensor: Loss tensor with the specified reduction applied.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure inputs and targets are of the same shape\n    if inputs.shape != targets.shape:\n        raise ValueError(\"Inputs and targets must have the same shape.\")\n    \n    # Apply the sigmoid function to the inputs\n    prob = torch.sigmoid(inputs)\n    \n    # Compute the binary cross entropy loss\n    bce_loss = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(inputs, targets, reduction='none')\n    \n    # Compute the modulating factor\n    p_t = prob * targets + (1 - prob) * (1 - targets)\n    modulating_factor = (1 - p_t) ** gamma\n    \n    # Compute the alpha factor\n    alpha_factor = alpha * targets + (1 - alpha) * (1 - targets)\n    \n    # Compute the focal loss\n    focal_loss = alpha_factor * modulating_factor * bce_loss\n    \n    # Apply reduction\n    if reduction == 'mean':\n        return focal_loss.mean()\n    elif reduction == 'sum':\n        return focal_loss.sum()\n    elif reduction == 'none':\n        return focal_loss\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Invalid reduction type: {reduction}. Expected 'none', 'mean', or 'sum'.\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# inputs = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)\n# targets = torch.randint(0, 2, (10,), dtype=torch.float32)\n# loss = sigmoid_focal_loss(inputs, targets, alpha=0.25, gamma=2.0, reduction='mean')\n# print(loss)\n```\n\nThis function calculates the focal loss for each element in the input tensor and applies the specified reduction method. The `sigmoid` function is used to convert logits to probabilities, and the binary cross-entropy loss is computed using `F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits`, which is numerically stable. The modulating factor and alpha factor are then applied to compute the focal loss.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called sigmoid_focal_loss that calculates the focal loss used in RetinaNet for dense detection. The function takes in four parameters: inputs (a float tensor of arbitrary shape representing predictions), targets (a float tensor with the same shape as inputs representing binary classification labels), alpha (a float weighting factor to balance positive vs negative examples), gamma (a float exponent to balance easy vs hard examples), and reduction (a string specifying the reduction option for the output). The function returns a loss tensor with the specified reduction option applied. The function implements the focal loss formula and handles different reduction options such as 'none', 'mean', or 'sum'.",
