    "result": "To create the `_get_perspective_coeffs` function using PyTorch, we need to set up a system of linear equations that relates the original coordinates to the transformed coordinates. The perspective transformation can be described by the following equations for each point:\n\n\\[ x' = \\frac{ax + by + c}{gx + hy + 1} \\]\n\\[ y' = \\frac{dx + ey + f}{gx + hy + 1} \\]\n\nWhere \\((x, y)\\) are the original coordinates and \\((x', y')\\) are the transformed coordinates. We need to solve for the coefficients \\(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h\\).\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _get_perspective_coeffs(startpoints, endpoints):\n    if len(startpoints) != 4 or len(endpoints) != 4:\n        raise ValueError(\"Exactly four startpoints and endpoints are required.\")\n    \n    # Convert points to torch tensors\n    startpoints = torch.tensor(startpoints, dtype=torch.float64)\n    endpoints = torch.tensor(endpoints, dtype=torch.float64)\n    \n    # Prepare the matrix A and vector B for the equation A * coeffs = B\n    A = []\n    B = []\n    \n    for (x, y), (x_prime, y_prime) in zip(startpoints, endpoints):\n        A.append([x, y, 1, 0, 0, 0, -x_prime * x, -x_prime * y])\n        A.append([0, 0, 0, x, y, 1, -y_prime * x, -y_prime * y])\n        B.append(x_prime)\n        B.append(y_prime)\n    \n    A = torch.tensor(A, dtype=torch.float64)\n    B = torch.tensor(B, dtype=torch.float64)\n    \n    # Solve the linear system A * coeffs = B using least squares\n    coeffs, _ = torch.lstsq(B, A)\n    \n    # The result from torch.lstsq includes extra rows, we only need the first 8 coefficients\n    coeffs = coeffs[:8].squeeze()\n    \n    # Convert to single precision before returning\n    return coeffs.to(dtype=torch.float32).tolist()\n\n# Example usage:\nstartpoints = [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]\nendpoints = [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]\ncoeffs = _get_perspective_coeffs(startpoints, endpoints)\nprint(coeffs)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if both `startpoints` and `endpoints` contain exactly four points. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Matrix Setup**: We set up a matrix `A` and a vector `B` to represent the system of equations derived from the perspective transformation equations.\n\n3. **Least Squares Solution**: We use `torch.lstsq` to solve the system of equations. This function returns a solution that minimizes the least squares error.\n\n4. **Precision Conversion**: The coefficients are initially computed in double precision for numerical stability and then converted to single precision before returning.\n\nThis function will compute the perspective transformation coefficients needed to map the original image coordinates to the transformed image coordinates.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function named `_get_perspective_coeffs` that calculates the eight coefficients required for performing a perspective transformation on an image. The function takes two lists of four coordinate pairs each, `startpoints` and `endpoints`, corresponding to the corners of the original and transformed images, respectively. It computes the coefficients `(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h)` using least squares to map each pixel `(x, y)` in the original image to its new position in the transformed image. The function should validate that exactly four corners are provided for both inputs, raising a `ValueError` if this condition is not met. Calculations should be performed in double precision to ensure numerical stability, with results converted to single precision before returning. Use the PyTorch library for matrix operations and numerical computations.",
