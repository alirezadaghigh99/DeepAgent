    "result": "To create a function called `_create_identity_grid` that generates a grid of normalized coordinates for a given image size, we can use PyTorch to handle the tensor operations. The grid will contain coordinates that are normalized to the range [-1, 1], which is commonly used in spatial transformations like grid sampling in PyTorch.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _create_identity_grid(size):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a grid of normalized coordinates for a given image size.\n\n    Parameters:\n    size (list of int): A list containing the dimensions of the grid (height, width).\n\n    Returns:\n    torch.Tensor: A tensor containing the grid coordinates, normalized to the range [-1, 1].\n    \"\"\"\n    height, width = size\n    # Create a grid of coordinates\n    y_coords = torch.linspace(-1, 1, steps=height)\n    x_coords = torch.linspace(-1, 1, steps=width)\n    \n    # Create a meshgrid from the coordinates\n    grid_y, grid_x = torch.meshgrid(y_coords, x_coords, indexing='ij')\n    \n    # Stack the grids to create a grid of (x, y) coordinates\n    grid = torch.stack((grid_x, grid_y), dim=-1)\n    \n    return grid\n\n# Example usage:\nsize = [4, 4]\ngrid = _create_identity_grid(size)\nprint(grid)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Parameters**: The function takes a list `size` containing two integers: the height and width of the grid.\n\n2. **Coordinate Generation**:\n   - `torch.linspace(-1, 1, steps=height)` generates `height` evenly spaced values between -1 and 1 for the y-coordinates.\n   - `torch.linspace(-1, 1, steps=width)` generates `width` evenly spaced values between -1 and 1 for the x-coordinates.\n\n3. **Meshgrid Creation**:\n   - `torch.meshgrid` is used to create a grid of coordinates. The `indexing='ij'` argument ensures that the first dimension corresponds to the y-coordinates and the second to the x-coordinates, which is the standard for image processing.\n\n4. **Stacking**:\n   - `torch.stack((grid_x, grid_y), dim=-1)` stacks the x and y coordinate grids along a new dimension, resulting in a grid of shape `(height, width, 2)`, where each element is a coordinate pair `(x, y)`.\n\n5. **Return**:\n   - The function returns the grid as a PyTorch tensor, which can be used for spatial transformations.\n\nThis function is useful for tasks involving spatial transformations, such as image warping or sampling, where normalized coordinates are required.",
