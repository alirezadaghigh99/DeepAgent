    "result": "To implement the `normalize` method for the `GeneralizedRCNNTransform` class, we need to ensure that the input image is of a floating-point type and then apply normalization using the provided mean and standard deviation values.

If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n\n2. **Mean and Std Conversion**: The mean and standard deviation lists are converted to tensors and moved to the same device as the input image. This ensures compatibility during operations.\n\n3. **Broadcasting**: The mean and standard deviation tensors are reshaped to be broadcastable with the input image. This is done by adding dimensions to match the image's channel dimension.\n\n4. **Normalization**: The image is normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.\n\nThis method assumes that the input image is in the format `[C, H, W]`, where `C` is the number of channels, `H` is the height, and `W` is the width.",
