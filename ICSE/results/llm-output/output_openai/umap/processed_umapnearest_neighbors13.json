    "result": "To implement the `nearest_neighbors` function, we can utilize the `NearestNeighbors` class from the `scikit-learn` library, which provides a flexible and efficient way to compute nearest neighbors using various metrics. Additionally, for approximate nearest neighbor search, we can use the `Annoy` library, which is particularly useful for high-dimensional data and supports angular distance metrics.\n\nBelow is the implementation of the `nearest_neighbors` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors\nfrom annoy import AnnoyIndex\n\ndef nearest_neighbors(X, n_neighbors=5, metric='euclidean', metric_args=None, \n                      use_angular_rp_trees=False, random_state=None, \n                      low_memory=False, verbose=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the n_neighbors nearest points for each data point in X under a specified metric.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - X: array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)\n        The input data.\n    - n_neighbors: int\n        The number of nearest neighbors to compute.\n    - metric: str\n        The distance metric to use.\n    - metric_args: dict\n        Additional arguments for the metric function.\n    - use_angular_rp_trees: bool\n        Whether to use angular random projection trees for approximation.\n    - random_state: int or None\n        Random state for approximate computations.\n    - low_memory: bool\n        If True, use a memory-efficient algorithm.\n    - verbose: bool\n        If True, print status data during computation.\n\n    Returns:\n    - knn_indices: array, shape (n_samples, n_neighbors)\n        Indices of the n_neighbors closest points in the dataset.\n    - knn_dists: array, shape (n_samples, n_neighbors)\n        Distances to the n_neighbors closest points in the dataset.\n    - rp_forest: list or None\n        List of trees representing the random projection forest used for searching.\n    \"\"\"\n    if metric_args is None:\n        metric_args = {}\n\n    n_samples, n_features = X.shape\n\n    if use_angular_rp_trees:\n        if verbose:\n            print(\"Using Annoy for approximate nearest neighbors with angular distance.\")\n        \n        # Initialize Annoy index\n        annoy_index = AnnoyIndex(n_features, 'angular')\n        if random_state is not None:\n            np.random.seed(random_state)\n        \n        # Build the index\n        for i in range(n_samples):\n            annoy_index.add_item(i, X[i])\n        \n        annoy_index.build(10)  # You can adjust the number of trees\n\n        # Query the index\n        knn_indices = np.zeros((n_samples, n_neighbors), dtype=int)\n        knn_dists = np.zeros((n_samples, n_neighbors), dtype=float)\n        \n        for i in range(n_samples):\n            indices, dists = annoy_index.get_nns_by_item(i, n_neighbors, include_distances=True)\n            knn_indices[i] = indices\n            knn_dists[i] = dists\n        \n        rp_forest = [annoy_index]\n    else:\n        if verbose:\n            print(\"Using exact nearest neighbors with scikit-learn.\")\n        \n        # Use scikit-learn's NearestNeighbors\n        nn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=n_neighbors, metric=metric, **metric_args)\n        nn.fit(X)\n        \n        knn_dists, knn_indices = nn.kneighbors(X)\n        rp_forest = None\n\n    return knn_indices, knn_dists, rp_forest\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Exact Nearest Neighbors**: Uses `scikit-learn`'s `NearestNeighbors` for exact computation.\n- **Approximate Nearest Neighbors**: Uses `Annoy` for approximate computation with angular distance.\n- **Verbose Output**: Provides status updates if `verbose` is set to `True`.\n- **Random State**: Allows for reproducibility in approximate computations.\n- **Metric Arguments**: Allows additional arguments for the metric function.\n\n### Dependencies:\n- `scikit-learn`: For exact nearest neighbor search.\n- `annoy`: For approximate nearest neighbor search with angular distance.\n\nMake sure to install the required libraries using `pip install scikit-learn annoy` if they are not already installed.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called nearest_neighbors that computes the n_neighbors nearest points for each data point in X under a specified metric. The function takes in parameters such as the input data X, the number of nearest neighbors to compute, the metric to use, any arguments for the metric computation function, whether to use angular rp trees in nearest neighbor approximation, a random state for approximate computations, and optional parameters like low_memory and verbose. \n\nThe function returns three outputs: knn_indices, an array of shape (n_samples, n_neighbors) containing the indices of the n_neighbors closest points in the dataset; knn_dists, an array of shape (n_samples, n_neighbors) containing the distances to the n_neighbors closest points in the dataset; and rp_forest, a list of trees representing the random projection forest used for searching (or None if not used). If verbose is set to True, the function will print status data during the computation.",
