    "result": "To complete the `block_diag_embed` function, we need to create a block diagonal tensor from the input tensor `mat`. The input tensor has a shape of `(..., B, M, N)`, and we want to return a tensor of shape `(..., B * M, B * N)` where each `M x N` block from the input tensor is placed along the diagonal of the output tensor.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef block_diag_embed(mat):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a tensor of shape (..., B, M, N) and returns a block diagonal tensor\n    of shape (..., B x M, B x N).\n\n    :param torch.Tensor mat: an input tensor with 3 or more dimensions\n    :returns torch.Tensor: a block diagonal tensor with dimension `m.dim() - 1`\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the shape of the input tensor\n    *batch_dims, B, M, N = mat.shape\n    \n    # Create an output tensor filled with zeros\n    # The shape of the output tensor is (..., B * M, B * N)\n    out_shape = (*batch_dims, B * M, B * N)\n    out = torch.zeros(out_shape, dtype=mat.dtype, device=mat.device)\n    \n    # Create an index tensor for the diagonal blocks\n    # This will help us place each MxN block in the correct position\n    for i in range(B):\n        out[..., i * M:(i + 1) * M, i * N:(i + 1) * N] = mat[..., i, :, :]\n    \n    return out\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Shape**: The input tensor `mat` has a shape of `(..., B, M, N)`. The `*batch_dims` captures any leading dimensions before the last three dimensions.\n\n2. **Output Shape**: The desired output shape is `(..., B * M, B * N)`. We initialize a tensor `out` with this shape, filled with zeros.\n\n3. **Block Diagonal Construction**: We iterate over each block index `i` from `0` to `B-1`. For each block, we place the `M x N` block from `mat` into the corresponding diagonal position in `out`.\n\n4. **Indexing**: The slicing `i * M:(i + 1) * M` and `i * N:(i + 1) * N` ensures that each block is placed in the correct diagonal position.\n\nThis function will efficiently create a block diagonal tensor from the input tensor.",
