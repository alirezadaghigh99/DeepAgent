    "result": "To implement the `loss_and_grads` method for the `ReweightedWakeSleep` class, we need to compute the losses for both the model and the guide using the `_loss` method, and then perform backpropagation to update the parameters of both the model and the guide. Here's how you can implement this method:\n\n```python\nclass ReweightedWakeSleep(ELBO):\n    def __init__(self, num_particles=2, insomnia=1.0, model_has_params=True, num_sleep_particles=None, vectorize_particles=True, max_plate_nesting=float(\"inf\"), strict_enumeration_warning=True):\n        # Initialization code\n        pass\n\n    def _get_trace(self, model, guide, args, kwargs):\n        # Returns a single trace from the guide, and the model that is run against it\n        pass\n\n    def _loss(self, model, guide, args, kwargs):\n        # Returns the computed model loss (wake_theta_loss) and guide loss (phi_loss)\n        pass\n\n    def loss(self, model, guide, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Calls _loss method and returns the model loss and guide loss\n        wake_theta_loss, wake_phi_loss = self._loss(model, guide, args, kwargs)\n        return wake_theta_loss, wake_phi_loss\n\n    def loss_and_grads(self, model, guide, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Compute the losses\n        wake_theta_loss, wake_phi_loss = self._loss(model, guide, args, kwargs)\n\n        # Zero gradients for both model and guide\n        model.zero_grad()\n        guide.zero_grad()\n\n        # Backpropagate the wake-theta loss through the model\n        wake_theta_loss.backward(retain_graph=True)\n\n        # Backpropagate the wake-phi loss through the guide\n        wake_phi_loss.backward()\n\n        # Note: In practice, you would typically have optimizers for both the model and guide\n        # and you would call optimizer.step() for each after this to update the parameters.\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Compute Losses**: The method starts by calling the `_loss` method to compute the `wake_theta_loss` and `wake_phi_loss`. These represent the losses for the model and the guide, respectively.\n\n2. **Zero Gradients**: Before performing backpropagation, it's important to zero out the gradients of both the model and the guide to prevent accumulation from previous iterations.\n\n3. **Backpropagation**:\n   - The `wake_theta_loss` is backpropagated through the model. The `retain_graph=True` argument is used to retain the computation graph, which is necessary if you plan to perform additional backward passes on the same graph.\n   - The `wake_phi_loss` is backpropagated through the guide. Since this is the last backward pass, we don't need to retain the graph.\n\n4. **Parameter Update**: Although not shown in the method, typically you would have optimizers for both the model and the guide. After calling `backward()`, you would call `optimizer.step()` for each to update the parameters based on the computed gradients.\n\nThis method effectively implements the Reweighted Wake-Sleep algorithm by computing the necessary gradients and preparing them for parameter updates.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `loss_and_grads` for the `ReweightedWakeSleep` class. This method should compute the Reweighted Wake-Sleep (RWS) estimators for the model (`wake-theta`) and the guide (`wake-phi`), and perform backpropagation to update both sets of parameters. It should leverage the `_loss` method to calculate the losses and then execute the gradient update.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass ReweightedWakeSleep(ELBO):\n    def __init__(self, num_particles=2, insomnia=1.0, model_has_params=True, num_sleep_particles=None, vectorize_particles=True, max_plate_nesting=float(\"inf\"), strict_enumeration_warning=True):\n        # Initialization code\n\n    def _get_trace(self, model, guide, args, kwargs):\n        # Returns a single trace from the guide, and the model that is run against it\n\n    def _loss(self, model, guide, args, kwargs):\n        # Returns the computed model loss (wake_theta_loss) and guide loss (phi_loss)\n\n    def loss(self, model, guide, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Calls _loss method and returns the model loss and guide loss\n\n    def loss_and_grads(self, model, guide, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Method to implement\n```",
