    "result": "To implement a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) of type II in PyTorch, scaled to be orthonormal, you can use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) as a building block. PyTorch does not have a built-in DCT function, but you can implement it using the FFT and some mathematical transformations. Below is a Python function that performs the DCT-II with orthonormal scaling:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport math\n\ndef dct(x, dim=-1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the Discrete Cosine Transform of type II, scaled to be orthonormal.\n\n    :param Tensor x: The input signal.\n    :param int dim: Dimension along which to compute DCT.\n    :rtype: Tensor\n    \"\"\"\n    N = x.size(dim)\n    \n    # Compute weights for orthonormal scaling\n    scale = torch.sqrt(2.0 / N) * torch.ones(N, device=x.device)\n    scale[0] = scale[0] / math.sqrt(2.0)\n    \n    # Compute the DCT using FFT\n    x = torch.fft.fft(torch.cat([x, x.flip(dims=[dim])], dim=dim), dim=dim)\n    x = x[..., :N].real\n    \n    # Apply the scaling\n    x = x * scale\n    \n    return x\n\n# Example usage:\n# x = torch.tensor([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\n# dct_result = dct(x)\n# print(dct_result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Scaling**: The `scale` tensor is used to ensure the DCT is orthonormal. The first element is scaled by an additional factor of `1/sqrt(2)`.\n\n2. **FFT-based DCT**: The DCT-II can be computed using the FFT by exploiting the symmetry properties of the cosine transform. The input signal is concatenated with its flipped version, and then the FFT is computed. The real part of the first half of the result corresponds to the DCT-II.\n\n3. **Dimension**: The `dim` parameter specifies the dimension along which to compute the DCT. This allows the function to be used on multi-dimensional tensors.\n\nThis implementation should be equivalent to `scipy.fftpack.dct` with `norm=\"ortho\"`. Note that this function assumes the input is real-valued and operates along the specified dimension.",
