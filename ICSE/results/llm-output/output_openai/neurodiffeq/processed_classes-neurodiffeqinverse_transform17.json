    "result": "To complete the `inverse_transform` function, we need to apply the inverse transformation to the whitened data `x` using the inverse transformation matrix `self.transform_inv`. This assumes that `self.transform_inv` is a precomputed matrix that can reverse the whitening transformation applied to the data. Here's how you can complete the function:\n\n```python\ndef inverse_transform(self, x: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n    r\"\"\"Apply the inverse transform to the whitened data.\n\n    Args:\n        x: Whitened data.\n\n    Returns:\n        Original data.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not self.fitted:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Needs to be fitted first before running. Please call fit or set include_fit to True.\")\n\n    if not self.compute_inv:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Did not compute inverse ZCA. Please set compute_inv to True\")\n\n    if self.transform_inv is None:\n        raise TypeError(\"The transform inverse should be a Tensor. Gotcha None.\")\n\n    # Apply the inverse transformation\n    original_data = x @ self.transform_inv\n\n    # If there was a mean subtraction during the whitening process, add it back\n    if hasattr(self, 'mean') and self.mean is not None:\n        original_data += self.mean\n\n    return original_data\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Matrix Multiplication**: The inverse transformation is typically a matrix multiplication of the whitened data `x` with the inverse transformation matrix `self.transform_inv`. This is done using the `@` operator, which is the matrix multiplication operator in Python for tensors.\n  \n- **Mean Addition**: If the whitening process involved subtracting the mean of the data, you need to add it back to the transformed data to recover the original data. This assumes that `self.mean` holds the mean that was subtracted during the whitening process.\n\n- **Error Handling**: The function checks if the transformation has been fitted and if the inverse transformation matrix is available, raising appropriate errors if not.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the class has attributes `fitted`, `compute_inv`, `transform_inv`, and optionally `mean`, which are set during the fitting process.",
