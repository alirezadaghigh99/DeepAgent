    "result": "To create the `issues_from_scores` function, we need to handle both image-level and pixel-level scores, and identify issues based on a given threshold. The function will return different outputs depending on whether pixel-level scores are provided. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import Optional, Union\n\ndef issues_from_scores(image_scores: np.ndarray, \n                       pixel_scores: Optional[np.ndarray] = None, \n                       threshold: float = None) -> Union[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:\n    # Validate inputs\n    if image_scores is None:\n        raise ValueError(\"image_scores cannot be None.\")\n    if threshold is None or not (0 <= threshold <= 1):\n        raise ValueError(\"threshold must be a float between 0 and 1.\")\n    \n    # Check if pixel_scores is provided\n    if pixel_scores is not None:\n        # Validate pixel_scores shape\n        if pixel_scores.shape[0] != image_scores.shape[0]:\n            raise ValueError(\"The first dimension of pixel_scores must match the length of image_scores.\")\n        \n        # Create a boolean mask for pixel-level issues\n        pixel_issues_mask = pixel_scores < threshold\n        return pixel_issues_mask\n    else:\n        # Identify image indices with scores below the threshold\n        image_issues_indices = np.where(image_scores < threshold)[0]\n        return image_issues_indices\n\n# Example usage:\n# image_scores = np.array([0.9, 0.4, 0.7])\n# pixel_scores = np.array([[[0.8, 0.3], [0.5, 0.9]], [[0.2, 0.4], [0.6, 0.1]], [[0.9, 0.8], [0.7, 0.6]]])\n# threshold = 0.5\n# result = issues_from_scores(image_scores, pixel_scores, threshold)\n# print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**:\n   - The function checks if `image_scores` is `None` and raises a `ValueError` if so.\n   - It also checks if `threshold` is `None` or outside the range [0, 1], raising a `ValueError` if the condition is met.\n\n2. **Handling Pixel Scores**:\n   - If `pixel_scores` is provided, the function checks that its first dimension matches the length of `image_scores`.\n   - It then creates a boolean mask where each pixel is marked as `True` if its score is below the threshold.\n\n3. **Handling Image Scores**:\n   - If `pixel_scores` is not provided, the function identifies indices of images with scores below the threshold using `np.where`.\n\nThis function is flexible and can handle both image-level and pixel-level quality assessments, providing appropriate outputs for each case.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `issues_from_scores` that identifies mislabeled pixels or images based on label quality scores and a user-defined `threshold`. The function should accept:\n\n- `image_scores` (np.ndarray): Array of shape `(N,)` for image scores.\n- `pixel_scores` (Optional[np.ndarray]): Optional array of shape `(N, H, W)` for pixel-level scores.\n- `threshold` (float): A value between 0 and 1 that determines which scores are considered issues.\n\nThe function returns:\n\n- A boolean mask (np.ndarray) if `pixel_scores` is provided, marking issues as `True`.\n- An array of image indices (np.ndarray) if `pixel_scores` is not provided, for images below the threshold.\n\nRaise `ValueError` if `image_scores` is `None`, if `threshold` is outside the [0, 1] range, or if `threshold` is `None`.",
