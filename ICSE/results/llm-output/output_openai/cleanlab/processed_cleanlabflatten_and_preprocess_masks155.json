    "result": "To achieve the desired functionality, we need to create a function `flatten_and_preprocess_masks` that takes two inputs: a `labels` array and a `pred_probs` array. The function will flatten the `labels` array and reshape the `pred_probs` array so that its channels align with the flattened `labels`. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef flatten_and_preprocess_masks(labels, pred_probs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Flattens a 2D/3D labels array and reshapes a 4D pred_probs array so that the channels\n    align with the flattened labels.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - labels (np.ndarray): A 2D or 3D array of labels.\n    - pred_probs (np.ndarray): A 4D array of predicted probabilities with shape\n                               (batch_size, height, width, num_classes).\n\n    Returns:\n    - flattened_labels (np.ndarray): A 1D array of flattened labels.\n    - reshaped_pred_probs (np.ndarray): A 2D array of reshaped predicted probabilities\n                                        with shape (num_samples, num_classes).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Flatten the labels array\n    flattened_labels = labels.flatten()\n\n    # Reshape the pred_probs array\n    # The shape of pred_probs is expected to be (batch_size, height, width, num_classes)\n    # We need to reshape it to (num_samples, num_classes) where num_samples = batch_size * height * width\n    batch_size, height, width, num_classes = pred_probs.shape\n    reshaped_pred_probs = pred_probs.reshape(-1, num_classes)\n\n    return flattened_labels, reshaped_pred_probs\n\n# Example usage:\n# labels = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])\n# pred_probs = np.random.rand(1, 2, 2, 3)  # Example shape: (1, 2, 2, 3)\n# flattened_labels, reshaped_pred_probs = flatten_and_preprocess_masks(labels, pred_probs)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Flattening the `labels` array**:\n   - The `labels` array is flattened using the `flatten()` method, which converts it into a 1D array. This is necessary to align it with the reshaped `pred_probs`.\n\n2. **Reshaping the `pred_probs` array**:\n   - The `pred_probs` array is expected to have a shape of `(batch_size, height, width, num_classes)`.\n   - We reshape it to a 2D array with shape `(num_samples, num_classes)`, where `num_samples` is the product of `batch_size`, `height`, and `width`. This is done using the `reshape(-1, num_classes)` method, which automatically calculates the number of samples.\n\nThis function will ensure that the `labels` and `pred_probs` are aligned correctly for further processing, such as computing loss or evaluating model performance.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `flatten_and_preprocess_masks` that flattens a 2D/3D `labels` array and reshapes a 4D `pred_probs` array so that the channels align with the flattened labels. Return the flattened `labels` and the transposed, flattened `pred_probs`.",
