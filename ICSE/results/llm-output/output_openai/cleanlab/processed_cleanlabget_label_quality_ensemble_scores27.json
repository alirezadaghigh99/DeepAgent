    "result": "To implement the `get_label_quality_ensemble_scores` function, we need to consider several components:\n\n1. **Label Quality Scoring Method**: This could involve calculating metrics like log loss or other measures that indicate how well the predicted probabilities align with the true labels.\n\n2. **Adjusting Predicted Probabilities**: This might involve normalizing or calibrating the probabilities.\n\n3. **Weighting Scheme**: This involves aggregating scores from different models using specified weights.\n\n4. **Custom Weights**: If the \"custom\" weighting scheme is chosen, these weights will be used.\n\n5. **Log Loss Search**: This could involve searching over a range of thresholds to find the best log loss score.\n\nHere's a Python function that implements these components:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics import log_loss\n\ndef get_label_quality_ensemble_scores(labels, pred_probs_list, method='log_loss', adjust_pred_probs=False,\n                                      weight_ensemble_members_by='uniform', custom_weights=None,\n                                      log_loss_search_T_values=None, verbose=False):\n    if verbose:\n        print(\"Starting label quality score computation...\")\n\n    # Validate inputs\n    num_models = len(pred_probs_list)\n    num_samples = len(labels)\n    \n    if weight_ensemble_members_by == 'custom' and (custom_weights is None or len(custom_weights) != num_models):\n        raise ValueError(\"Custom weights must be provided and match the number of models.\")\n    \n    if weight_ensemble_members_by == 'uniform':\n        weights = np.ones(num_models) / num_models\n    elif weight_ensemble_members_by == 'custom':\n        weights = custom_weights\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported weighting scheme.\")\n    \n    if verbose:\n        print(f\"Using weights: {weights}\")\n\n    # Function to adjust predicted probabilities if needed\n    def adjust_probs(probs):\n        if adjust_pred_probs:\n            # Example adjustment: normalize probabilities\n            return probs / np.sum(probs, axis=1, keepdims=True)\n        return probs\n\n    # Calculate label quality scores for each model\n    scores_list = []\n    for i, pred_probs in enumerate(pred_probs_list):\n        adjusted_probs = adjust_probs(pred_probs)\n        \n        if method == 'log_loss':\n            # Calculate log loss for each sample\n            scores = np.array([log_loss([label], [prob]) for label, prob in zip(labels, adjusted_probs)])\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Unsupported method.\")\n        \n        scores_list.append(scores)\n        \n        if verbose:\n            print(f\"Model {i+1} scores calculated.\")\n\n    # Aggregate scores using the specified weighting scheme\n    aggregated_scores = np.zeros(num_samples)\n    for i, scores in enumerate(scores_list):\n        aggregated_scores += weights[i] * scores\n\n    # Normalize scores to be between 0 and 1\n    min_score, max_score = np.min(aggregated_scores), np.max(aggregated_scores)\n    if max_score > min_score:\n        aggregated_scores = (aggregated_scores - min_score) / (max_score - min_score)\n    \n    if verbose:\n        print(\"Label quality scores computed and normalized.\")\n\n    return aggregated_scores\n\n# Example usage:\n# labels = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1])\n# pred_probs_list = [np.array([[0.8, 0.2], [0.3, 0.7], [0.6, 0.4], [0.4, 0.6]]),\n#                    np.array([[0.7, 0.3], [0.4, 0.6], [0.5, 0.5], [0.3, 0.7]])]\n# scores = get_label_quality_ensemble_scores(labels, pred_probs_list, verbose=True)\n# print(scores)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Log Loss Calculation**: The function uses log loss as the default method to calculate label quality scores. This is a common choice for evaluating the quality of probabilistic predictions.\n- **Probability Adjustment**: The function includes a placeholder for adjusting probabilities, which can be customized as needed.\n- **Weighting Scheme**: The function supports uniform and custom weighting schemes for aggregating scores from different models.\n- **Normalization**: The final scores are normalized to be between 0 and 1, where lower scores indicate more likely mislabeled examples.\n- **Verbose Output**: The function provides optional verbose output to trace the computation steps.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called get_label_quality_ensemble_scores that calculates label quality scores based on predictions from an ensemble of models. The function takes in the following parameters:\n\n- labels: a numpy array containing the labels for the dataset.\n- pred_probs_list: a list of numpy arrays, where each array represents the predicted probabilities from one model in the ensemble.\n- method: a string indicating the label quality scoring method to use.\n- adjust_pred_probs: a boolean indicating whether to adjust the predicted probabilities.\n- weight_ensemble_members_by: a string indicating the weighting scheme to aggregate scores from each model.\n- custom_weights: a numpy array of custom weights if using the \"custom\" weighting scheme.\n- log_loss_search_T_values: a list of float values for log loss search.\n- verbose: a boolean indicating whether to print statements.\n\nThe function computes label quality scores for each model's predicted probabilities and aggregates them based on the chosen weighting scheme. The output is a numpy array containing one score (between 0 and 1) per example, where lower scores indicate more likely mislabeled examples.",
