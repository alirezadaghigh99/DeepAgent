    "result": "To create the `_get_min_pred_prob` function as described, you'll need to iterate over each NumPy array in the `predictions` list, extract the last column from each array, and then find the minimum value among all these extracted values. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef _get_min_pred_prob(predictions):\n    # Initialize pred_probs with a value of 1.0\n    pred_probs = [1.0]\n    \n    # Iterate through each prediction in the input list\n    for prediction in predictions:\n        # Check if the prediction array is not empty\n        if prediction.size > 0:\n            # Extract the last column of each class prediction\n            last_column = prediction[:, -1]\n            # Append the extracted values to the pred_probs list\n            pred_probs.extend(last_column)\n    \n    # Calculate the minimum value in the pred_probs list\n    min_pred_prob = np.min(pred_probs)\n    \n    return min_pred_prob\n\n# Example usage:\n# predictions = [np.array([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]]), np.array([[0.7, 0.8, 0.9]])]\n# print(_get_min_pred_prob(predictions))  # Output: 0.3\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**: The `pred_probs` list is initialized with a value of `1.0` to ensure that `np.min` has a value to compare against, even if no valid predictions are found.\n- **Iteration and Extraction**: For each prediction array, the function checks if the array is not empty. It then extracts the last column of the array using `prediction[:, -1]` and appends these values to the `pred_probs` list.\n- **Finding the Minimum**: Finally, the function uses `np.min(pred_probs)` to find and return the minimum value from the `pred_probs` list.\n\nThis function will handle cases where some prediction arrays might be empty, ensuring that the minimum value is always computed correctly.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called _get_min_pred_prob that takes in a list of NumPy arrays called predictions. The function returns a float value which is the minimum prediction probability out of all the predictions in the input list. The function first initializes a list called pred_probs with a value of 1.0 to avoid calling np.min on an empty array. It then iterates through each prediction in the input list, extracts the last column of each class prediction, and appends it to the pred_probs list. Finally, the function calculates the minimum value in the pred_probs list using np.min and returns it as the output.",
