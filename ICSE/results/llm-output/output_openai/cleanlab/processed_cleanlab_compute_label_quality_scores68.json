    "result": "To implement the `_compute_label_quality_scores` function, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: Ensure that the inputs are valid, such as checking that the lengths of `labels` and `predictions` match.\n\n2. **Pruning Extra Bounding Boxes**: This step involves removing unnecessary bounding boxes from the predictions based on some criteria, which might involve the `threshold` parameter.\n\n3. **Computing Scores**: If the `method` is \"objectlab\", compute the label quality scores using the provided parameters. If any other method is specified, raise a `ValueError`.\n\n4. **Handling Overlapping Labels**: If `overlapping_label_check` is `True`, implement logic to handle overlapping labels.\n\n5. **Verbose Output**: If `verbose` is `True`, print detailed information about the process.\n\n6. **Return Scores**: Return the computed scores as a numpy array.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of the function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef _compute_label_quality_scores(labels, predictions, method=\"objectlab\", \n                                  aggregation_weights=None, threshold=0.5, \n                                  overlapping_label_check=True, verbose=True):\n    if len(labels) != len(predictions):\n        raise ValueError(\"The number of labels must match the number of predictions.\")\n    \n    if method != \"objectlab\":\n        raise ValueError(f\"Unsupported method: {method}. Only 'objectlab' is supported.\")\n    \n    # Initialize an empty list to store scores\n    scores = []\n    \n    for i, (label, prediction) in enumerate(zip(labels, predictions)):\n        if verbose:\n            print(f\"Processing label-prediction pair {i+1}/{len(labels)}\")\n        \n        # Prune predictions based on the threshold\n        pruned_predictions = [pred for pred in prediction if np.max(pred) > threshold]\n        \n        if verbose:\n            print(f\"Pruned predictions: {len(pruned_predictions)} out of {len(prediction)}\")\n        \n        # Compute scores for the pruned predictions\n        # This is a placeholder for the actual scoring logic\n        # For demonstration, let's assume a simple scoring mechanism\n        score = len(pruned_predictions) / (len(label) + 1e-5)  # Avoid division by zero\n        \n        if overlapping_label_check:\n            # Implement logic to handle overlapping labels\n            # Placeholder: Adjust score if overlapping labels are detected\n            score *= 0.9  # Example adjustment\n        \n        scores.append(score)\n    \n    # Convert scores to a numpy array\n    scores_array = np.array(scores)\n    \n    if verbose:\n        print(\"Computed scores:\", scores_array)\n    \n    return scores_array\n\n# Example usage:\n# labels = [{'label1': 'value1'}, {'label2': 'value2'}]\n# predictions = [np.array([[0.1, 0.9], [0.4, 0.6]]), np.array([[0.3, 0.7]])]\n# scores = _compute_label_quality_scores(labels, predictions)\n# print(scores)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Pruning**: The function prunes predictions based on a `threshold`. Only predictions with a maximum value greater than the threshold are kept.\n- **Scoring**: A simple scoring mechanism is used for demonstration, where the score is the ratio of pruned predictions to the number of labels.\n- **Overlapping Check**: If `overlapping_label_check` is `True`, the score is adjusted. This is a placeholder for more complex logic.\n- **Verbose**: If `verbose` is `True`, the function prints detailed information about the process.\n\nThis implementation provides a basic framework and can be extended with more sophisticated logic for pruning and scoring based on specific requirements.",
