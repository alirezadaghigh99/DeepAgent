    "result": "To create a function `cast_like` that casts `tensor1` to the same data type as `tensor2`, we need to handle different types of inputs, such as lists, tuples, and tensors. In Python, the most common library for handling tensors is NumPy, so we'll use it to manage the data type casting. If `tensor1` and `tensor2` are lists or tuples, we'll first convert them to NumPy arrays, perform the casting, and then convert them back to their original type if necessary.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `cast_like` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef cast_like(tensor1, tensor2):\n    # Convert tensor1 and tensor2 to numpy arrays if they are lists or tuples\n    if isinstance(tensor1, (list, tuple)):\n        tensor1 = np.array(tensor1)\n    if isinstance(tensor2, (list, tuple)):\n        tensor2 = np.array(tensor2)\n    \n    # Get the data type of tensor2\n    target_dtype = tensor2.dtype\n    \n    # Cast tensor1 to the data type of tensor2\n    casted_tensor1 = tensor1.astype(target_dtype)\n    \n    # Convert back to list or tuple if the original tensor1 was a list or tuple\n    if isinstance(tensor1, list):\n        return casted_tensor1.tolist()\n    elif isinstance(tensor1, tuple):\n        return tuple(casted_tensor1.tolist())\n    else:\n        return casted_tensor1\n\n# Example usage:\ntensor1 = [1, 2, 3]\ntensor2 = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\nresult = cast_like(tensor1, tensor2)\nprint(result)  # Output: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The function first checks if `tensor1` and `tensor2` are lists or tuples. If they are, it converts them to NumPy arrays for easier manipulation.\n\n2. **Data Type Extraction**: It extracts the data type of `tensor2` using `tensor2.dtype`.\n\n3. **Casting**: It casts `tensor1` to the data type of `tensor2` using the `astype` method.\n\n4. **Output Conversion**: If the original `tensor1` was a list or tuple, the function converts the result back to the same type. Otherwise, it returns the NumPy array.\n\nThis function should handle the casting of `tensor1` to match the data type of `tensor2` while maintaining the original structure of `tensor1` if it was a list or tuple.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called cast_like that takes in two parameters, tensor1 and tensor2. The function casts tensor1 to the same data type as tensor2.\n\nYou should be aware that input can be list or tuple aswell.",
