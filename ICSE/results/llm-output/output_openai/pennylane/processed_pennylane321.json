    "result": "To complete the `allequal` function, we need to ensure that it can handle tensors of different types, such as PyTorch tensors and NumPy arrays, and compare them element-wise. We'll convert both tensors to NumPy arrays if they aren't already, and then use NumPy's comparison and `np.all` to determine if they are element-wise equal. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport torch\n\ndef allequal(tensor1, tensor2, **kwargs):\n    \"\"\"Returns True if two tensors are element-wise equal along a given axis.\n\n    This function is equivalent to calling ``np.all(tensor1 == tensor2, **kwargs)``,\n    but allows for ``tensor1`` and ``tensor2`` to differ in type.\n\n    Args:\n        tensor1 (tensor_like): tensor to compare\n        tensor2 (tensor_like): tensor to compare\n        **kwargs: Accepts any keyword argument that is accepted by ``np.all``,\n            such as ``axis``, ``out``, and ``keepdims``. See the `NumPy documentation\n            <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.all.html>`__ for\n            more details.\n\n    Returns:\n        ndarray, bool: If ``axis=None``, a logical AND reduction is applied to all elements\n        and a boolean will be returned, indicating if all elements evaluate to ``True``. Otherwise,\n        a boolean NumPy array will be returned.\n\n    **Example**\n\n    >>> a = torch.tensor([1, 2])\n    >>> b = np.array([1, 2])\n    >>> allequal(a, b)\n    True\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert tensor1 to a NumPy array if it is a PyTorch tensor\n    if isinstance(tensor1, torch.Tensor):\n        tensor1 = tensor1.numpy()\n    \n    # Convert tensor2 to a NumPy array if it is a PyTorch tensor\n    if isinstance(tensor2, torch.Tensor):\n        tensor2 = tensor2.numpy()\n    \n    # Use np.all to check if all elements are equal\n    return np.all(tensor1 == tensor2, **kwargs)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Type Conversion**: We first check if `tensor1` or `tensor2` is a PyTorch tensor. If so, we convert it to a NumPy array using the `.numpy()` method.\n- **Element-wise Comparison**: We then perform an element-wise comparison using `tensor1 == tensor2`.\n- **Logical AND Reduction**: Finally, we use `np.all` to check if all elements are `True`, applying any additional keyword arguments provided.\n\nThis function should work for both PyTorch tensors and NumPy arrays, allowing for flexible comparisons across different tensor types.",
