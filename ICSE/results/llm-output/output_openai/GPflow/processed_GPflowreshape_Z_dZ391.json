    "result": "To complete the `reshape_Z_dZ` function, we need to reshape the input sequences of tensors `zs` and `dzs` into the desired output format. The function should return two tensors: `Z` and `dZ`. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom typing import Sequence, Tuple\n\ndef reshape_Z_dZ(\n    zs: Sequence[tf.Tensor], dzs: Sequence[tf.Tensor]\n) -> Tuple[tf.Tensor, tf.Tensor]:\n    \"\"\"\n    :param zs: List with d rank-1 Tensors, with shapes N1, N2, ..., Nd\n    :param dzs: List with d rank-1 Tensors, with shapes N1, N2, ..., Nd\n    :returns: points Z, Tensor with shape [N1*N2*...*Nd, D],\n        and weights dZ, Tensor with shape [N1*N2*...*Nd, 1]\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the number of dimensions\n    D = len(zs)\n    \n    # Create a meshgrid from the input tensors\n    meshgrid = tf.meshgrid(*zs, indexing='ij')\n    \n    # Flatten each grid to create a list of flattened tensors\n    flattened_grids = [tf.reshape(grid, [-1]) for grid in meshgrid]\n    \n    # Stack the flattened tensors along the last axis to form Z\n    Z = tf.stack(flattened_grids, axis=-1)\n    \n    # Calculate the product of all dzs to get the weights\n    dZ = tf.reduce_prod(tf.stack(tf.meshgrid(*dzs, indexing='ij'), axis=-1), axis=-1)\n    \n    # Reshape dZ to have shape [N1*N2*...*Nd, 1]\n    dZ = tf.reshape(dZ, [-1, 1])\n    \n    return Z, dZ\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Meshgrid Creation**: We use `tf.meshgrid` to create a grid from the input tensors `zs`. This function generates coordinate matrices from coordinate vectors, which is useful for creating a grid of points.\n\n2. **Flattening**: Each grid is flattened using `tf.reshape` to create a list of 1D tensors. This is necessary to stack them into a 2D tensor.\n\n3. **Stacking**: The flattened grids are stacked along the last axis using `tf.stack`, resulting in a tensor `Z` with shape `[N1*N2*...*Nd, D]`.\n\n4. **Weight Calculation**: We use `tf.meshgrid` again on `dzs` to create a grid of weights, then compute the product across all dimensions using `tf.reduce_prod`. This gives us the weights for each point in the grid.\n\n5. **Reshaping Weights**: Finally, `dZ` is reshaped to have the shape `[N1*N2*...*Nd, 1]`.\n\nThis function assumes that `zs` and `dzs` are sequences of 1D tensors, and it uses TensorFlow operations to perform the necessary reshaping and stacking.",
