    "result": "To compute the KL divergence between two Gaussian distributions, we need to consider the formula for the KL divergence between two multivariate Gaussian distributions \\( q(x) = \\mathcal{N}(q_{\\mu}, q_{\\Sigma}) \\) and \\( p(x) = \\mathcal{N}(0, K) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{KL}(q \\parallel p) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\text{tr}(K^{-1} q_{\\Sigma}) + q_{\\mu}^T K^{-1} q_{\\mu} - M + \\log\\left(\\frac{\\det(K)}{\\det(q_{\\Sigma})}\\right) \\right)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( q_{\\mu} \\) is the mean of the distribution \\( q \\).\n- \\( q_{\\Sigma} \\) is the covariance matrix of the distribution \\( q \\).\n- \\( K \\) is the covariance matrix of the distribution \\( p \\).\n- \\( M \\) is the dimensionality of the distribution.\n\nThe function `gauss_kl` will handle different cases for \\( q_{\\Sigma} \\) and \\( K \\) as described.
