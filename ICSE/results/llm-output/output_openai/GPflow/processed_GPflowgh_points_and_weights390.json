    "result": "To complete the `gh_points_and_weights` function, we need to compute the Gauss-Hermite quadrature points and weights. These are used for approximating integrals of the form given in the docstring. The Gauss-Hermite quadrature is particularly useful for integrals involving the Gaussian weight function.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function using TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\ndef gh_points_and_weights(n_gh: int) -> Tuple[tf.Tensor, tf.Tensor]:\n    r\"\"\"\n    Given the number of Gauss-Hermite points n_gh,\n    returns the points z and the weights dz to perform the following\n    uni-dimensional gaussian quadrature:\n\n    X ~ N(mean, stddev\u00b2)\n    E[f(X)] = \u222b f(x) p(x) dx = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_gh} f(mean + stddev*z_i) dz_i\n\n    :param n_gh: Number of Gauss-Hermite points\n    :returns: Points z and weights dz to compute uni-dimensional gaussian expectation\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use numpy to get the Gauss-Hermite points and weights\n    z, dz = np.polynomial.hermite.hermgauss(n_gh)\n    \n    # Convert them to TensorFlow tensors\n    z = tf.convert_to_tensor(z, dtype=tf.float32)\n    dz = tf.convert_to_tensor(dz, dtype=tf.float32)\n    \n    # Adjust weights for the standard normal distribution\n    dz = dz * tf.exp(z**2)\n    \n    return z, dz\n\n# Example usage:\nn_gh = 3\nz, dz = gh_points_and_weights(n_gh)\nprint(\"Points:\", z.numpy())\nprint(\"Weights:\", dz.numpy())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`np.polynomial.hermite.hermgauss(n_gh)`**: This function from NumPy computes the Gauss-Hermite quadrature points and weights. The points are the roots of the Hermite polynomial, and the weights are used to approximate the integral.\n- **Conversion to TensorFlow Tensors**: We convert the NumPy arrays to TensorFlow tensors to maintain compatibility with TensorFlow operations.\n- **Adjusting Weights**: The weights are adjusted by multiplying by `exp(z^2)` to account for the standard normal distribution, as the original weights are for the weight function `exp(-x^2)`.\n\nThis function will return the points and weights needed to perform Gaussian quadrature for a normal distribution with a specified number of points.",
