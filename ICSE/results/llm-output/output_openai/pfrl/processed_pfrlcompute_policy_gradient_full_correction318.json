Adjustments may be needed based on specific use cases or additional constraints.",
    "prompt": "Create a function `compute_policy_gradient_full_correction` that calculates the off-policy bias correction term for all actions. The function takes `action_distrib` and `action_distrib_mu` (both `torch.distributions.Categorical`), `action_value`, a scalar `v`, and a `truncation_threshold`. It computes the importance weights, applies truncation, calculates the advantage, and returns the corrected policy gradient. Ensure assertions on input types and values, and use `torch.no_grad()` during weight computation.",
