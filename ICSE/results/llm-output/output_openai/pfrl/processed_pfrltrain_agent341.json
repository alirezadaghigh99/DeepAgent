    "result": "To implement the `train_agent` function, we need to consider several key components: initializing the environment and agent, running the training loop, handling episodes, logging, evaluating the agent, and saving the model. Below is a detailed implementation of the function:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef train_agent(agent, env, steps, outdir, checkpoint_freq=None, max_episode_len=None,\n                step_offset=0, evaluator=None, successful_score=None, step_hooks=None,\n                eval_during_episode=False, logger=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Train an agent in a given environment for a specified number of steps.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - agent: The agent to be trained.\n    - env: The environment in which the agent is trained.\n    - steps: Total number of steps to train the agent.\n    - outdir: Directory to save the model and logs.\n    - checkpoint_freq: Frequency of saving the model.\n    - max_episode_len: Maximum length of an episode.\n    - step_offset: Initial step offset.\n    - evaluator: Function to evaluate the agent.\n    - successful_score: Score to consider the training successful.\n    - step_hooks: List of functions to call at each step.\n    - eval_during_episode: Whether to evaluate during episodes.\n    - logger: Logger for logging information.\n\n    Returns:\n    - A list of evaluation episode statistics dictionaries.\n    \"\"\"\n    if logger is None:\n        import logging\n        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n    # Initialize variables\n    episode_rewards = []\n    episode_idx = 0\n    eval_stats_history = []\n\n    # Reset the environment\n    obs = env.reset()\n    episode_reward = 0\n    episode_step = 0\n\n    # Training loop\n    for step in range(step_offset, steps):\n        # Select an action\n        action = agent.act(obs)\n\n        # Take the action in the environment\n        new_obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)\n        episode_reward += reward\n        episode_step += 1\n\n        # Update the agent\n        agent.observe(obs, action, reward, new_obs, done)\n        obs = new_obs\n\n        # Call step hooks if any\n        if step_hooks:\n            for hook in step_hooks:\n                hook(env, agent, step)\n\n        # Check if the episode is done\n        if done or (max_episode_len and episode_step >= max_episode_len):\n            # Log episode statistics\n            episode_rewards.append(episode_reward)\n            logger.info(f'Episode {episode_idx} finished with reward {episode_reward}')\n            obs = env.reset()\n            episode_reward = 0\n            episode_step = 0\n            episode_idx += 1\n\n        # Save the model at checkpoints\n        if checkpoint_freq and step % checkpoint_freq == 0:\n            agent.save(os.path.join(outdir, f'checkpoint_{step}.pth'))\n\n        # Evaluate the agent\n        if evaluator and (eval_during_episode or done):\n            eval_stats = evaluator(env, agent)\n            eval_stats_history.append(eval_stats)\n            logger.info(f'Evaluation at step {step}: {eval_stats}')\n\n            # Check for successful score\n            if successful_score and eval_stats.get('mean_reward', 0) >= successful_score:\n                logger.info(f'Successful score reached: {eval_stats[\"mean_reward\"]}')\n                agent.save(os.path.join(outdir, 'successful_model.pth'))\n                break\n\n    # Final save\n    agent.save(os.path.join(outdir, 'final_model.pth'))\n\n    return eval_stats_history\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The function initializes necessary variables, including episode rewards, episode index, and evaluation statistics history. It also resets the environment to get the initial observation.\n\n2. **Training Loop**: The loop runs for the specified number of steps. In each iteration:\n   - The agent selects an action based on the current observation.\n   - The environment executes the action and returns the new observation, reward, and done flag.\n   - The agent updates its internal state with the observed transition.\n   - If any step hooks are provided, they are called with the current environment, agent, and step.\n   - If the episode ends, it logs the episode reward and resets the environment.\n\n3. **Checkpointing**: The agent's model is saved at specified checkpoints.\n\n4. **Evaluation**: If an evaluator is provided, the agent is evaluated either during episodes or at the end of episodes. The evaluation statistics are logged and stored.\n\n5. **Successful Score**: If a successful score is defined and achieved, the model is saved, and training is terminated.\n\n6. **Final Save**: The agent's model is saved at the end of training.\n\n7. **Return**: The function returns a list of evaluation statistics collected during training.",
    "prompt": "Define a Python function called train_agent that takes in the following parameters: agent, env, steps, outdir, checkpoint_freq (optional), max_episode_len (optional), step_offset (default 0), evaluator (optional), successful_score (optional), step_hooks (optional), eval_during_episode (default False), and logger (optional). The function runs a training loop for the agent in the environment for a specified number of steps. It logs the progress and evaluates the agent's performance during training.\n\nThe function initializes variables for episode rewards and index, resets the environment, and iterates through steps while taking actions, observing outcomes, and updating the agent. It also handles episode endings, logging statistics, and evaluating the agent's performance. If a successful score is achieved or an exception occurs, the function saves the agent's model. Finally, it returns a list of evaluation statistics history.\n\nThe output of the function is a list of evaluation episode statistics dictionaries.",
