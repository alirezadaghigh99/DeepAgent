    "result": "To implement the `_apply_categorical_projection` function, we need to perform a series of calculations to project the given probabilities `y_probs` onto the new atom values `z`. This involves clamping, calculating indices, and distributing probabilities across the new atom values. We'll use PyTorch for tensor operations, which is efficient for such numerical computations.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _apply_categorical_projection(y, y_probs, z):\n    # Ensure inputs are torch tensors\n    if not isinstance(y, torch.Tensor):\n        y = torch.tensor(y)\n    if not isinstance(y_probs, torch.Tensor):\n        y_probs = torch.tensor(y_probs)\n    if not isinstance(z, torch.Tensor):\n        z = torch.tensor(z)\n\n    # Check the shapes of the inputs\n    assert y.ndim == 2, \"y should be a 2D array with shape (batch_size, n_atoms)\"\n    assert y_probs.ndim == 2, \"y_probs should be a 2D array with shape (batch_size, n_atoms)\"\n    assert z.ndim == 1, \"z should be a 1D array with shape (n_atoms,)\"\n    assert y.shape == y_probs.shape, \"y and y_probs should have the same shape\"\n    assert y.shape[1] == z.shape[0], \"The number of atoms in y and z should match\"\n\n    batch_size, n_atoms = y.shape\n\n    # Calculate the width of each atom in z\n    delta_z = z[1] - z[0]\n\n    # Initialize the output probabilities\n    z_probs = torch.zeros_like(y_probs)\n\n    # For each batch\n    for b in range(batch_size):\n        # For each atom in y\n        for j in range(n_atoms):\n            # Calculate bj\n            bj = (y[b, j] - z[0]) / delta_z\n\n            # Calculate the lower and upper indices\n            l = torch.floor(bj).long()\n            u = torch.ceil(bj).long()\n\n            # Clamp the indices to be within valid range\n            l = torch.clamp(l, 0, n_atoms - 1)\n            u = torch.clamp(u, 0, n_atoms - 1)\n\n            # Calculate the mass to be distributed\n            m_l = (u.float() - bj) * y_probs[b, j]\n            m_u = (bj - l.float()) * y_probs[b, j]\n\n            # Accumulate the probabilities\n            z_probs[b, l] += m_l\n            z_probs[b, u] += m_u\n\n    return z_probs\n\n# Example usage:\n# y = torch.tensor([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]])\n# y_probs = torch.tensor([[0.2, 0.5, 0.3], [0.1, 0.6, 0.3]])\n# z = torch.tensor([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])\n# z_probs = _apply_categorical_projection(y, y_probs, z)\n# print(z_probs)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks that the inputs are of the correct shape and type. It converts inputs to PyTorch tensors if they are not already.\n\n2. **Initialization**: The function initializes an output tensor `z_probs` to store the projected probabilities.\n\n3. **Projection Calculation**:\n   - For each batch and each atom, it calculates the index `bj` where the atom value `y[b, j]` would fall in the new atom space `z`.\n   - It computes the lower (`l`) and upper (`u`) indices by flooring and ceiling `bj`.\n   - The indices are clamped to ensure they are within the valid range of `z`.\n   - The probabilities are distributed between these indices based on their distance from `bj`.\n\n4. **Output**: The function returns the projected probabilities `z_probs`.\n\nThis function effectively redistributes the probabilities from the original atom values to the new atom values, ensuring that the total probability mass is preserved.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called _apply_categorical_projection that implements . The function takes three inputs: y (an ndarray representing values of atoms before projection with shape (batch_size, n_atoms)), y_probs (an ndarray representing probabilities of atoms with shape (batch_size, n_atoms)), and z (an ndarray representing values of atoms after projection with shape (n_atoms,)). It is assumed that the values in z are sorted in ascending order and evenly spaced.\n\nThe function calculates the probabilities of atoms whose values are z and returns an ndarray with shape (batch_size, n_atoms). The function performs various calculations including clamping values, calculating bj, floor and ceil values, and accumulating m_l and m_u based on the provided formulas. The function utilizes torch functions for these calculations.\n\nThe function ensures that the shapes of the input arrays are as expected and performs necessary assertions. The final output is the probabilities of atoms whose values are z.",
