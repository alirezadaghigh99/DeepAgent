    "result": "To complete the `_perform_padding` function, we need to ensure that the height (`H`) and width (`W`) of the image are both divisible by 16. This involves calculating the necessary padding for each dimension and applying it to the image. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\n\ndef _perform_padding(image: Tensor) -> tuple[Tensor, int, int]:\n    # Get the current height and width of the image\n    _, _, H, W = image.shape\n    \n    # Calculate the padding needed to make H and W divisible by 16\n    h_pad = (16 - H % 16) % 16\n    w_pad = (16 - W % 16) % 16\n    \n    # Calculate padding for each side\n    pad_top = h_pad // 2\n    pad_bottom = h_pad - pad_top\n    pad_left = w_pad // 2\n    pad_right = w_pad - pad_left\n    \n    # Apply padding to the image\n    image_padded = torch.nn.functional.pad(image, (pad_left, pad_right, pad_top, pad_bottom))\n    \n    return image_padded, h_pad, w_pad\n\n# Example usage:\n# image = torch.randn(1, 3, 30, 45)  # Example image tensor\n# padded_image, h_pad, w_pad = _perform_padding(image)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Calculate Padding**: We calculate how much padding is needed for both the height and width to make them divisible by 16. The formula `(16 - H % 16) % 16` ensures that if `H` is already divisible by 16, no padding is added.\n- **Distribute Padding**: The padding is distributed equally on both sides of the dimension. If the padding is odd, the extra pixel is added to the bottom or right side.\n- **Apply Padding**: We use `torch.nn.functional.pad` to apply the calculated padding to the image. The padding is specified in the order `(left, right, top, bottom)`.\n- **Return Values**: The function returns the padded image and the total padding applied to the height and width.",
