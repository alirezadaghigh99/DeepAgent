    "result": "To implement the `forward` function for the `STEFunction` class, you need to store any necessary context for the backward pass and return the output tensor. Since the `forward` function is part of a custom autograd `Function`, it should be a static method. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nfrom torch.autograd import Function\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom typing import Any, Optional, Callable\n\nclass STEFunction(Function):\n    \"\"\"Straight-Through Estimation (STE) function.\n\n    STE bridges the gradients between the input tensor and output tensor as if the function\n    was an identity function. Meanwhile, advanced gradient functions are also supported. e.g.\n    the output gradients can be mapped into [-1, 1] with ``F.hardtanh`` function.\n\n    Args:\n        grad_fn: function to restrain the gradient received. If None, no mapping will performed.\n\n    Example:\n        Let the gradients of ``torch.sign`` estimated from STE.\n        >>> input = torch.randn(4, requires_grad = True)\n        >>> output = torch.sign(input)\n        >>> loss = output.mean()\n        >>> loss.backward()\n        >>> input.grad\n        tensor([0., 0., 0., 0.])\n\n        >>> with torch.no_grad():\n        ...     output = torch.sign(input)\n        >>> out_est = STEFunction.apply(input, output)\n        >>> loss = out_est.mean()\n        >>> loss.backward()\n        >>> input.grad\n        tensor([0.2500, 0.2500, 0.2500, 0.2500])\n    \"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def forward(ctx: Any, input: Tensor, output: Tensor, grad_fn: Optional[Callable[..., Any]] = None) -> Tensor:\n        # Save the input and grad_fn for use in the backward pass\n        ctx.save_for_backward(input)\n        ctx.grad_fn = grad_fn\n        # Return the output as is, since STE acts like an identity function in the forward pass\n        return output\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Context (`ctx`)**: The `ctx` object is used to store information that you will need in the backward pass. Here, we store the `input` tensor and the `grad_fn` function.\n  \n- **Return Value**: The `forward` function returns the `output` tensor directly, as the STE function acts like an identity function in the forward pass.\n\n- **Gradient Function (`grad_fn`)**: The `grad_fn` is stored in the context to be potentially used in the backward pass to modify the gradients. This is not used in the `forward` function but will be important in the `backward` function.",
