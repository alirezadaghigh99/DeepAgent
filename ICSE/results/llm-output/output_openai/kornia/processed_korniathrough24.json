    "result": "To create a method `through` within the `ParametrizedLine` class that constructs a parametrized line between two points `p0` and `p1`, we need to calculate the direction vector from `p0` to `p1` and normalize it. This involves using PyTorch to handle the tensor operations, as it provides efficient computation for batch operations.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `through` method:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\nclass ParametrizedLine:\n    def __init__(self, point, direction):\n        self.point = point  # A point on the line\n        self.direction = direction  # The normalized direction vector of the line\n\n    @classmethod\n    def through(cls, p0, p1):\n        \"\"\"\n        Constructs a parametrized line between two points p0 and p1.\n\n        Parameters:\n        p0 (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, D) representing the starting points.\n        p1 (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, D) representing the ending points.\n\n        Returns:\n        ParametrizedLine: An instance of ParametrizedLine with the calculated direction.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Calculate the direction vector from p0 to p1\n        direction = p1 - p0\n        \n        # Normalize the direction vector\n        # Compute the norm of the direction vector\n        norm = torch.norm(direction, dim=1, keepdim=True)\n        \n        # Avoid division by zero by adding a small epsilon where norm is zero\n        epsilon = 1e-10\n        norm = torch.where(norm == 0, torch.tensor(epsilon, device=norm.device), norm)\n        \n        # Normalize the direction\n        normalized_direction = direction / norm\n        \n        # Return an instance of ParametrizedLine\n        return cls(point=p0, direction=normalized_direction)\n\n# Example usage:\n# p0 = torch.tensor([[0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0]])\n# p1 = torch.tensor([[1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 2.0]])\n# line = ParametrizedLine.through(p0, p1)\n# print(line.point)  # Should print the starting points p0\n# print(line.direction)  # Should print the normalized direction vectors\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Direction Vector Calculation**: The direction vector is calculated by subtracting `p0` from `p1`.\n\n2. **Normalization**: The direction vector is normalized by dividing it by its norm. The norm is calculated along the last dimension (dim=1) to handle each point in the batch separately.\n\n3. **Avoiding Division by Zero**: We add a small epsilon to the norm where it is zero to prevent division by zero errors. This ensures numerical stability.\n\n4. **Returning the Line**: An instance of `ParametrizedLine` is returned with the starting point `p0` and the normalized direction vector.\n\nThis method is efficient for batch processing and can handle multiple lines in parallel, which is useful in applications like computer graphics and physics simulations.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python method `through` within the `ParametrizedLine` class that constructs a parametrized line between two points, `p0` and `p1`. Both `p0` and `p1` are tensors of shape `(B, D)`, where `B` is the batch size and `D` is the dimensionality of the points. The method should return an instance of `ParametrizedLine` by calculating the direction vector from `p0` to `p1` and normalizing it. This method is useful in geometry-related tasks, such as computer graphics or physics simulations, where representing and working with lines in a parameterized form is necessary.",
