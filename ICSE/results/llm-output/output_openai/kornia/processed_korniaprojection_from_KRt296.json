    "result": "To complete the function `projection_from_KRt`, we need to construct the projection matrix \\( P \\) using the given camera matrix \\( K \\), rotation matrix \\( R \\), and translation vector \\( t \\). The projection matrix is computed as:\n\n\\[ P = K \\cdot [R | t] \\]\n\nWhere \\([R | t]\\) is the concatenation of the rotation matrix \\( R \\) and the translation vector \\( t \\) along the last axis. The resulting matrix will have a shape of \\((B, 3, 4)\\). Finally, we multiply this with the camera matrix \\( K \\) to get the projection matrix \\( P \\).\n\nHere's the complete function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\n\ndef projection_from_KRt(K: Tensor, R: Tensor, t: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n    # Check input shapes\n    if K.shape[-2:] != (3, 3):\n        raise AssertionError(f\"Expected K to have shape (B, 3, 3), but got {K.shape}\")\n    if R.shape[-2:] != (3, 3):\n        raise AssertionError(f\"Expected R to have shape (B, 3, 3), but got {R.shape}\")\n    if t.shape[-2:] != (3, 1):\n        raise AssertionError(f\"Expected t to have shape (B, 3, 1), but got {t.shape}\")\n    if not len(K.shape) == len(R.shape) == len(t.shape):\n        raise AssertionError(\"K, R, and t must have the same number of dimensions\")\n\n    # Concatenate R and t to form [R|t]\n    Rt = torch.cat((R, t), dim=-1)  # Shape: (B, 3, 4)\n\n    # Compute the projection matrix P\n    P = torch.bmm(K, Rt)  # Shape: (B, 3, 4)\n\n    # Convert P to shape (B, 4, 4) by adding a row [0, 0, 0, 1] at the bottom\n    batch_size = P.shape[0]\n    bottom_row = torch.tensor([0, 0, 0, 1], dtype=P.dtype, device=P.device).view(1, 1, 4)\n    bottom_row = bottom_row.expand(batch_size, 1, 4)  # Shape: (B, 1, 4)\n    P = torch.cat((P, bottom_row), dim=1)  # Shape: (B, 4, 4)\n\n    return P\n```\n\nThis function first checks the input shapes to ensure they are as expected. It then concatenates the rotation matrix \\( R \\) and the translation vector \\( t \\) to form a \\((B, 3, 4)\\) matrix. The projection matrix \\( P \\) is computed by multiplying \\( K \\) with \\([R | t]\\). Finally, a row \\([0, 0, 0, 1]\\) is added to the bottom to make \\( P \\) a \\((B, 4, 4)\\) matrix.",
