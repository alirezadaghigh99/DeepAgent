    "result": "To implement the `project_points_z1` function, we need to perform perspective division on the input points. This involves dividing the x and y coordinates of each point by its z coordinate to project it onto the canonical z=1 plane. The function will handle tensors of arbitrary shape as long as the last dimension is 3, representing the x, y, and z coordinates of the points.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef project_points_z1(points_in_camera):\n    \"\"\"\n    Projects points from the camera frame into the canonical z=1 plane.\n\n    Args:\n        points_in_camera (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (..., 3) representing the points to project.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: A tensor of shape (..., 2) representing the projected points.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure the input tensor has the correct shape\n    if points_in_camera.shape[-1] != 3:\n        raise ValueError(\"The last dimension of points_in_camera must be 3.\")\n\n    # Extract x, y, z components\n    x = points_in_camera[..., 0]\n    y = points_in_camera[..., 1]\n    z = points_in_camera[..., 2]\n\n    # Perform perspective division\n    x_proj = x / z\n    y_proj = y / z\n\n    # Stack the projected x and y components\n    projected_points = torch.stack((x_proj, y_proj), dim=-1)\n\n    return projected_points\n\n# Example usage\npoints = torch.tensor([1., 2., 3.])\nprint(project_points_z1(points))  # Output: tensor([0.3333, 0.6667])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Validation**: The function checks if the last dimension of the input tensor is 3, which is necessary for the x, y, and z coordinates.\n- **Perspective Division**: The x and y coordinates are divided by the z coordinate to project the points onto the z=1 plane.\n- **Output**: The function returns a tensor with the projected x and y coordinates, maintaining the original shape except for the last dimension, which becomes 2.\n\nThis function assumes that the input points are in front of the camera (z > 0). If any z value is zero, it will lead to a division by zero, which should be avoided as per the precondition.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called project_points_z1 that projects one or more points from the camera frame into the canonical z=1 plane through perspective division. The input is a tensor called points_in_camera with shape (..., 3) representing the points to project. The function has a precondition that the points are in front of the camera (z > 0). If this is not the case, the points will be projected to the canonical plane, but the resulting points will be behind the camera and may cause numerical issues for z == 0. The output is a tensor representing the projected points with shape (..., 2). An example usage of the function is as follows:\n\n```python\npoints = torch.tensor([1., 2., 3.])\nproject_points_z1(points)\n```\n\nThis will return a tensor with values [0.3333, 0.6667].",
