    "result": "To generate the `rt_matrix` function for the `PinholeCamera` class, we need to construct a 3x4 rotation-translation matrix using the extrinsics provided. The extrinsics matrix typically consists of a 3x3 rotation matrix and a 3x1 translation vector. Here's how you can implement the `rt_matrix` function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\n\nclass PinholeCamera:\n    def __init__(self, intrinsics: Tensor, extrinsics: Tensor, height: Tensor, width: Tensor) -> None:\n        self.height: Tensor = height\n        self.width: Tensor = width\n        self._intrinsics: Tensor = intrinsics\n        self._extrinsics: Tensor = extrinsics\n\n    def rt_matrix(self) -> Tensor:\n        \"\"\"\n        Returns the 3x4 rotation-translation matrix.\n\n        Returns:\n            Tensor of shape (B, 3, 4).\n        \"\"\"\n        # Assuming extrinsics is of shape (B, 4, 4) where the last row is [0, 0, 0, 1]\n        # Extract the rotation (3x3) and translation (3x1) components\n        rotation = self._extrinsics[:, :3, :3]  # Shape: (B, 3, 3)\n        translation = self._extrinsics[:, :3, 3:]  # Shape: (B, 3, 1)\n\n        # Concatenate rotation and translation to form a 3x4 matrix\n        rt_matrix = torch.cat((rotation, translation), dim=2)  # Shape: (B, 3, 4)\n\n        return rt_matrix\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Extrinsics Matrix**: Typically, the extrinsics matrix is a 4x4 matrix where the top-left 3x3 part is the rotation matrix, and the top-right 3x1 part is the translation vector. The last row is usually `[0, 0, 0, 1]` to make it a homogeneous transformation matrix.\n- **Rotation-Translation Matrix**: The function extracts the rotation and translation components from the extrinsics matrix and concatenates them to form a 3x4 matrix.\n- **Batch Dimension**: The function assumes that the extrinsics matrix has a batch dimension `B`, so it processes the matrices in a batch-wise manner.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the extrinsics matrix is provided in a standard format. If your extrinsics matrix is structured differently, you may need to adjust the slicing accordingly.",
