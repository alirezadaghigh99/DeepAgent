    "result": "To implement the `equalize_clahe` function, we need to apply Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to an input image tensor. This involves dividing the image into tiles, computing histograms for each tile, applying contrast limiting, and then interpolating between the tiles to reconstruct the equalized image. Here's how you can implement this in Python using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef equalize_clahe(input, clip_limit, grid_size, slow_and_differentiable=False):\n    # Error handling\n    if not isinstance(clip_limit, float):\n        raise TypeError(\"clip_limit must be a float.\")\n    if not (isinstance(grid_size, tuple) and len(grid_size) == 2 and all(isinstance(x, int) for x in grid_size)):\n        raise TypeError(\"grid_size must be a tuple of two integers.\")\n    if any(x <= 0 for x in grid_size):\n        raise ValueError(\"All elements of grid_size must be positive.\")\n\n    # Ensure input is a float tensor\n    input = input.float()\n\n    # Get the shape of the input\n    original_shape = input.shape\n    batch_dims = original_shape[:-3]\n    C, H, W = original_shape[-3:]\n\n    # Reshape input to (N, C, H, W) where N is the product of batch dimensions\n    input = input.view(-1, C, H, W)\n\n    # Calculate tile size\n    tile_h = H // grid_size[0]\n    tile_w = W // grid_size[1]\n\n    # Prepare output tensor\n    output = torch.zeros_like(input)\n\n    # Process each channel separately\n    for c in range(C):\n        channel = input[:, c, :, :]\n\n        # Divide the image into tiles and apply CLAHE\n        for i in range(grid_size[0]):\n            for j in range(grid_size[1]):\n                # Define the tile region\n                h_start = i * tile_h\n                h_end = (i + 1) * tile_h if i < grid_size[0] - 1 else H\n                w_start = j * tile_w\n                w_end = (j + 1) * tile_w if j < grid_size[1] - 1 else W\n\n                tile = channel[:, h_start:h_end, w_start:w_end]\n\n                # Compute histogram\n                hist = torch.histc(tile, bins=256, min=0.0, max=1.0)\n\n                # Clip histogram if clip_limit is set\n                if clip_limit > 0:\n                    excess = hist - clip_limit\n                    excess = torch.clamp(excess, min=0)\n                    hist = hist - excess\n                    hist += excess.sum() / 256  # Redistribute excess\n\n                # Compute CDF\n                cdf = hist.cumsum(0)\n                cdf = cdf / cdf[-1]  # Normalize\n\n                # Create LUT\n                lut = (cdf * 255).clamp(0, 255).byte()\n\n                # Apply LUT\n                tile_flat = (tile * 255).byte().view(-1)\n                equalized_tile = lut[tile_flat].float() / 255.0\n                equalized_tile = equalized_tile.view_as(tile)\n\n                # Place the equalized tile back into the output\n                output[:, c, h_start:h_end, w_start:w_end] = equalized_tile\n\n    # Reshape output back to original shape\n    output = output.view(*batch_dims, C, H, W)\n\n    return output\n\n# Example usage:\n# input_tensor = torch.rand((2, 3, 256, 256))  # Example input tensor\n# output_tensor = equalize_clahe(input_tensor, clip_limit=0.01, grid_size=(8, 8))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Handling**: The function first checks the types and values of `clip_limit` and `grid_size` to ensure they are valid.\n- **Reshaping**: The input tensor is reshaped to handle batch processing, ensuring that the function can process multiple images at once.\n- **Tile Processing**: The image is divided into tiles based on `grid_size`. For each tile, a histogram is computed, optionally clipped, and then used to create a lookup table (LUT) for equalization.\n- **Interpolation**: The equalized tiles are placed back into the output tensor, which is then reshaped to match the original input shape.\n- **Differentiability**: The `slow_and_differentiable` flag is included for future extensions, but the current implementation is not optimized for differentiability.\n\nThis function is designed to be flexible and handle images with multiple channels and batch dimensions, making it suitable for various image processing tasks.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `equalize_clahe` that applies Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to an input image tensor. The function should accept the following parameters:\n- `input`: A tensor representing one or more images, with values in the range [0, 1] and shape \\((*, C, H, W)\\), where \\(*\\) can include any number of batch dimensions.\n- `clip_limit`: A float that sets the threshold for contrast limiting. If set to 0, clipping is disabled.\n- `grid_size`: A tuple of two integers specifying the number of tiles to divide the image into in each direction.\n- `slow_and_differentiable`: A boolean flag to select an implementation that is slow but differentiable.\n\nThe function returns an image tensor with the same shape as the input after applying CLAHE.\n\n### Error Handling:\n- Raise a `TypeError` if `clip_limit` is not a float.\n- Raise a `TypeError` if `grid_size` is not a tuple of two integers.\n- Raise a `ValueError` if any element of `grid_size` is non-positive.\n\nThe function divides the input image into tiles, computes histograms for each tile, applies CLAHE using lookup tables (LUTs), and then reconstructs the equalized image by interpolating between the tiles. The function should handle batch processing and ensure the output is correctly shaped, even if the input was not in batch form. This function is useful in image processing tasks where enhancing the contrast of images is necessary, particularly in fields like computer vision or medical imaging.",
