    "result": "To create a function `make_upright` that rectifies an affine matrix to make it upright, we need to perform several steps. We'll use PyTorch for tensor operations and assume that the input tensor `laf` is of shape `(B, N, 2, 3)`. The function will check the validity of the input, compute the determinant, perform a 2x2 SVD, and then rectify the affine matrix. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef KORNIA_CHECK_LAF(laf):\n    if laf.ndim != 4 or laf.shape[2:] != (2, 3):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input LAF should have shape (B, N, 2, 3)\")\n\ndef make_upright(laf, eps=1e-10):\n    # Check the validity of the input affine matrix\n    KORNIA_CHECK_LAF(laf)\n    \n    # Extract the 2x2 affine part of the matrix\n    A = laf[..., :2, :2]  # Shape (B, N, 2, 2)\n    \n    # Compute the determinant of the 2x2 matrix\n    det = torch.det(A)\n    \n    # Perform SVD on the 2x2 matrix\n    U, S, Vt = torch.linalg.svd(A)\n    \n    # Create an identity matrix of shape (2, 2)\n    identity = torch.eye(2, device=laf.device, dtype=laf.dtype).expand_as(A)\n    \n    # Rectify the affine matrix by setting the rotation to identity\n    rectified_A = identity * S.unsqueeze(-1)\n    \n    # Scale the rectified matrix using the original determinant\n    scale_factor = det.abs().sqrt().unsqueeze(-1).unsqueeze(-1)\n    rectified_A = rectified_A * scale_factor\n    \n    # Replace the original affine part with the rectified one\n    rectified_laf = laf.clone()\n    rectified_laf[..., :2, :2] = rectified_A\n    \n    return rectified_laf\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    B, N = 2, 3  # Example batch and number of matrices\n    laf = torch.rand(B, N, 2, 3)  # Random affine matrices\n\n    rectified_laf = make_upright(laf)\n    print(\"Original LAF:\", laf)\n    print(\"Rectified LAF:\", rectified_laf)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function `KORNIA_CHECK_LAF` ensures that the input tensor `laf` has the correct shape `(B, N, 2, 3)`.\n\n2. **Determinant Calculation**: We extract the 2x2 part of the affine matrix and compute its determinant.\n\n3. **SVD**: We perform Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the 2x2 matrix to decompose it into `U`, `S`, and `Vt`.\n\n4. **Rectification**: We create an identity matrix and scale it by the singular values `S` to form a new rectified matrix. This effectively removes any rotation, making the matrix upright.\n\n5. **Scaling**: The rectified matrix is scaled by the square root of the absolute value of the determinant to preserve the original area scaling.\n\n6. **Output**: The function returns the rectified affine matrix with the same shape as the input.\n\nThis function should work for any batch size `B` and number of matrices `N`, and it uses PyTorch's efficient tensor operations to handle the computations.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called make_upright that rectifies an affine matrix to make it upright. The function takes in a tensor laf of shape (B, N, 2, 3) and an optional float eps for safe division. It returns the rectified affine matrix laf of the same shape (B, N, 2, 3). The function first checks the validity of the input affine matrix using KORNIA_CHECK_LAF. It then calculates the determinant of the affine matrix and uses it to rectify the matrix by resetting the rotation matrix to an identity. The function performs operations equivalent to a 2x2 SVD and sets the rotation matrix to an identity. The rectified affine matrix is then scaled using the original determinant and returned. An example usage of the function is provided using torch tensors.",
