    "result": "To compute the fundamental matrix using the 8-point algorithm with a weighted least squares solution, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Normalize the input points to improve numerical stability.\n2. Construct the design matrix \\( A \\) using the normalized points.\n3. Apply the weights to the design matrix.\n4. Solve the weighted least squares problem using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).\n5. Enforce the rank-2 constraint on the fundamental matrix.\n6. Denormalize the fundamental matrix to obtain the final result.\n\nHere's a Python function implementing these steps:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef normalize_points(points):\n    \"\"\"Normalize a set of points for numerical stability.\"\"\"\n    mean = points.mean(dim=1, keepdim=True)\n    std = points.std(dim=1, keepdim=True)\n    normalized_points = (points - mean) / std\n    T = torch.tensor([[1/std[0,0], 0, -mean[0,0]/std[0,0]],\n                      [0, 1/std[0,1], -mean[0,1]/std[0,1]],\n                      [0, 0, 1]], device=points.device)\n    return normalized_points, T\n\ndef run_8point(points1, points2, weights):\n    \"\"\"Compute the fundamental matrix using the weighted 8-point algorithm.\"\"\"\n    B, N, _ = points1.shape\n\n    # Normalize points\n    points1_normalized, T1 = normalize_points(points1)\n    points2_normalized, T2 = normalize_points(points2)\n\n    # Construct the design matrix A\n    x1, y1 = points1_normalized[..., 0], points1_normalized[..., 1]\n    x2, y2 = points2_normalized[..., 0], points2_normalized[..., 1]\n    A = torch.stack([x2*x1, x2*y1, x2, y2*x1, y2*y1, y2, x1, y1, torch.ones_like(x1)], dim=-1)\n\n    # Apply weights\n    W = weights.unsqueeze(-1)\n    A_weighted = W * A\n\n    # Solve the weighted least squares problem using SVD\n    _, _, V = torch.svd(A_weighted)\n    F = V[..., -1].view(B, 3, 3)\n\n    # Enforce the rank-2 constraint\n    U, S, Vt = torch.svd(F)\n    S[..., -1] = 0\n    F_rank2 = U @ torch.diag_embed(S) @ Vt\n\n    # Denormalize the fundamental matrix\n    F_final = T2.transpose(-1, -2) @ F_rank2 @ T1\n\n    return F_final\n\n# Example usage:\n# points1 = torch.rand((1, 8, 2))\n# points2 = torch.rand((1, 8, 2))\n# weights = torch.ones((1, 8))\n# F = run_8point(points1, points2, weights)\n# print(F)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Normalization**: The points are normalized to improve numerical stability. This involves translating the points to have zero mean and scaling them to have unit variance.\n- **Design Matrix**: The matrix \\( A \\) is constructed using the normalized coordinates of the points.\n- **Weighting**: The design matrix is weighted by the provided weights.\n- **SVD**: Singular Value Decomposition is used to solve the least squares problem. The last column of \\( V \\) (from SVD) gives the solution to the homogeneous equation.\n- **Rank-2 Constraint**: The fundamental matrix must be rank-2, so we enforce this by setting the smallest singular value to zero.\n- **Denormalization**: The fundamental matrix is denormalized to map back to the original coordinate system.\n\nThis function assumes that the input tensors are on the same device (e.g., CPU or GPU) and that the batch size \\( B \\) is consistent across inputs.",
