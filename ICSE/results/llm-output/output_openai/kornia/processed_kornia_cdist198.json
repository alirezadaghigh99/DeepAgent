    "result": "To create the `_cdist` function that computes the pairwise Euclidean distance between two tensors, we need to handle two scenarios: one where we can use `torch.cdist` directly, and another where we manually compute the distances using matrix operations. The manual computation is necessary when the tensors are safe for Metal Performance Shaders (MPS), which is a consideration for certain hardware accelerations.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `_cdist` function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _cdist(d1, d2):\n    # Check if tensors are safe for MPS\n    # For simplicity, let's assume that if the tensors are on a GPU, they are not safe for MPS\n    # This is a simplification and may not be accurate for all hardware configurations\n    if d1.is_cuda or d2.is_cuda:\n        # Use torch.cdist directly if not safe for MPS\n        return torch.cdist(d1, d2)\n    \n    # Manually compute the Euclidean distances using matrix operations\n    # Compute the squared norms of each row in d1 and d2\n    d1_squared = torch.sum(d1 ** 2, dim=1, keepdim=True)\n    d2_squared = torch.sum(d2 ** 2, dim=1, keepdim=True)\n    \n    # Compute the pairwise squared distances\n    # Use broadcasting to expand dimensions and perform matrix multiplication\n    # d1_squared: (m, 1), d2_squared: (n, 1)\n    # d1 @ d2.T: (m, n)\n    # Result: (m, n) = d1_squared + d2_squared.T - 2 * (d1 @ d2.T)\n    dists_squared = d1_squared + d2_squared.T - 2 * (d1 @ d2.T)\n    \n    # Clamp the result to a minimum of 0.0 to avoid negative distances due to numerical errors\n    dists_squared = torch.clamp(dists_squared, min=0.0)\n    \n    # Take the square root to get the final Euclidean distances\n    dists = torch.sqrt(dists_squared)\n    \n    return dists\n\n# Example usage:\n# d1 = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])\n# d2 = torch.tensor([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])\n# distances = _cdist(d1, d2)\n# print(distances)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **MPS Safety Check**: The function first checks if the tensors are on a CUDA device. This is a simplification to decide whether to use `torch.cdist` directly. In a real-world scenario, you might need a more sophisticated check based on your specific hardware and software environment.\n\n2. **Manual Distance Calculation**:\n   - **Squared Norms**: Compute the squared norms of each row in `d1` and `d2`.\n   - **Pairwise Squared Distances**: Use broadcasting and matrix multiplication to compute the pairwise squared distances.\n   - **Clamping**: Clamp the squared distances to ensure they are non-negative.\n   - **Square Root**: Take the square root of the clamped squared distances to get the Euclidean distances.\n\nThis function should work for any two-dimensional tensors `d1` and `d2` where the number of columns (features) matches.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `_cdist` that:\n\n- Takes two parameters:\n  - `d1`: A tensor.\n  - `d2`: Another tensor.\n- The function calculates the pairwise Euclidean distance between `d1` and `d2` similar to `torch.cdist`.\n- If both tensors are not safe for Metal Performance Shaders (MPS), the function will use `torch.cdist` directly.\n- Otherwise, the function manually computes the Euclidean distances using matrix operations:\n  - Computes the squared distance for each tensor.\n  - Repeats the squared distances and performs matrix multiplication.\n  - Clamps the result to a minimum of 0.0 and takes the square root to get the final distances.\n- Returns the computed distance matrix.",
