    "result": "To create the `normalize_transformation` function, we need to ensure that the input matrix `M` is at least 2x2 in size. The function will normalize the matrix such that the value in the last row and column is set to one. This is a common operation in computer graphics and robotics, where transformation matrices often need to be normalized for consistent operations.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef normalize_transformation(M, eps=1e-8):\n    # Ensure the input is a numpy array\n    M = np.array(M)\n    \n    # Check that the input matrix has at least 2 dimensions\n    assert M.ndim >= 2, \"Input matrix must have at least 2 dimensions\"\n    \n    # Get the shape of the matrix\n    rows, cols = M.shape\n    \n    # Ensure the matrix is at least 2x2\n    assert rows >= 2 and cols >= 2, \"Input matrix must be at least 2x2 in size\"\n    \n    # Get the value at the last row and column\n    last_value = M[-1, -1]\n    \n    # Avoid division by zero by ensuring last_value is not too close to zero\n    if abs(last_value) < eps:\n        raise ValueError(\"The value at the last row and column is too close to zero, cannot normalize.\")\n    \n    # Normalize the matrix\n    normalized_M = M / last_value\n    \n    # Set the last element to exactly 1 to avoid numerical issues\n    normalized_M[-1, -1] = 1.0\n    \n    return normalized_M\n\n# Example usage:\n# M = np.array([[2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 2]])\n# normalized_M = normalize_transformation(M)\n# print(normalized_M)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: \n   - The function first converts the input `M` to a numpy array to ensure compatibility with numpy operations.\n   - It checks that `M` has at least 2 dimensions using `M.ndim`.\n   - It also checks that the matrix is at least 2x2 in size.\n\n2. **Normalization**:\n   - The function retrieves the value at the last row and column (`M[-1, -1]`).\n   - It checks if this value is too close to zero to avoid division by zero errors. If it is, a `ValueError` is raised.\n   - The entire matrix is then divided by this value to normalize it.\n   - Finally, the last element is explicitly set to 1.0 to ensure numerical stability.\n\nThis function will work for any transformation matrix with at least 2x2 dimensions, ensuring that the matrix is properly normalized for further computations.",
    "prompt": "---\n\nCreate a Python function `normalize_transformation` that:\n\n- Accepts two parameters:\n  - `M`: A tensor representing a transformation matrix of any shape with at least 2x2 dimensions.\n  - `eps`: A small float value (default is `1e-8`) used to avoid numerical instabilities during backpropagation.\n- The function normalizes the input transformation matrix `M` so that the value in the last row and column is set to one.\n- Returns the normalized transformation matrix with the same shape as the input.\n\nErrors:\n- Raises an `AssertionError` if the input matrix `M` has fewer than 2 dimensions.",
