    "result": "To create the `fundamental_from_projections` function, we need to ensure that the input projection matrices `P1` and `P2` have the correct shape and data type. The function will compute the fundamental matrix using the determinants of specific submatrices derived from the input projections. Here's how you can implement this in Python using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef fundamental_from_projections(P1, P2):\n    # Ensure the input tensors are of the correct shape\n    assert P1.ndim >= 3 and P1.shape[-2:] == (3, 4), \"P1 must have shape (*, 3, 4)\"\n    assert P2.ndim >= 3 and P2.shape[-2:] == (3, 4), \"P2 must have shape (*, 3, 4)\"\n    assert P1.shape[:-2] == P2.shape[:-2], \"P1 and P2 must have matching batch dimensions\"\n    \n    # Convert inputs to float32 if they are not float32 or float64\n    if P1.dtype not in [torch.float32, torch.float64]:\n        P1 = P1.to(torch.float32)\n    if P2.dtype not in [torch.float32, torch.float64]:\n        P2 = P2.to(torch.float32)\n    \n    # Extract the submatrices from P1 and P2\n    def submatrix(P, i, j):\n        # Remove the i-th row and j-th column\n        return torch.cat((P[..., :i, :], P[..., i+1:, :]), dim=-2)[..., :, torch.cat((torch.arange(j), torch.arange(j+1, 4)))]\n\n    # Compute the fundamental matrix using determinants of submatrices\n    F = torch.zeros(P1.shape[:-2] + (3, 3), dtype=P1.dtype, device=P1.device)\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            # Compute the determinant of the submatrix\n            sub_det = torch.det(submatrix(P1, i, 3) @ submatrix(P2, j, 3).transpose(-1, -2))\n            F[..., i, j] = sub_det\n    \n    return F\n\n# Example usage:\n# P1 = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)  # Example batch of 2 projection matrices\n# P2 = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)\n# F = fundamental_from_projections(P1, P2)\n# print(F.shape)  # Should print torch.Size([2, 3, 3])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Shape and Type Checks**: The function first checks that `P1` and `P2` have the correct shape and matching batch dimensions. It also ensures that the data type is either `float32` or `float64`, converting to `float32` if necessary.\n\n2. **Submatrix Extraction**: The `submatrix` function extracts a submatrix by removing the specified row and column. This is used to compute the determinants needed for the fundamental matrix.\n\n3. **Fundamental Matrix Calculation**: The fundamental matrix `F` is computed by iterating over each element and calculating the determinant of the product of submatrices from `P1` and `P2`.\n\n4. **Batch Processing**: The function supports batch processing, allowing for multiple projection matrices to be processed simultaneously.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input projection matrices are valid and that the computation of the fundamental matrix is based on the determinants of the submatrices as described.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function named `fundamental_from_projections` that calculates the fundamental matrix from two projection matrices (`P1` and `P2`). The function should ensure that both projection matrices have the correct shape of `(*, 3, 4)` and matching batch dimensions, raising an `AssertionError` if these conditions are not met. The function computes the fundamental matrix using the determinants of specific submatrices derived from the input projections and returns a tensor of shape `(*, 3, 3)`. The function should handle different data types, converting the inputs to `torch.float32` if they are not already in `float32` or `float64`.",
