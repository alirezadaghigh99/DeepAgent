    "result": "To implement the function `convert_points_to_homogeneous` and the helper function `_convert_affinematrix_to_homography_impl`, we need to handle tensors and perform operations to convert Euclidean points to homogeneous coordinates. We'll use PyTorch for tensor operations, as it is a popular library for such tasks. Here's how you can implement these functions:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef convert_points_to_homogeneous(points):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert Euclidean points to homogeneous coordinates.\n\n    Args:\n        points (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (*, N, D) representing Euclidean points.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: A tensor of shape (*, N, D+1) representing points in homogeneous coordinates.\n\n    Raises:\n        TypeError: If the input is not a tensor.\n        ValueError: If the input tensor has fewer than two dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(points, torch.Tensor):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a torch.Tensor.\")\n    \n    if points.dim() < 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input tensor must have at least two dimensions.\")\n    \n    # Get the shape of the input tensor\n    *batch_dims, N, D = points.shape\n    \n    # Create a tensor of ones with the same batch dimensions and N\n    ones = torch.ones(*batch_dims, N, 1, dtype=points.dtype, device=points.device)\n    \n    # Concatenate the ones to the last dimension of the points tensor\n    homogeneous_points = torch.cat((points, ones), dim=-1)\n    \n    return homogeneous_points\n\ndef _convert_affinematrix_to_homography_impl(affine_matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert an affine transformation matrix to a homography matrix.\n\n    Args:\n        affine_matrix (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (*, D, D+1) representing affine matrices.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: A tensor of shape (*, D+1, D+1) representing homography matrices.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(affine_matrix, torch.Tensor):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a torch.Tensor.\")\n    \n    if affine_matrix.dim() < 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input tensor must have at least two dimensions.\")\n    \n    # Get the shape of the input tensor\n    *batch_dims, D, D_plus_1 = affine_matrix.shape\n    \n    if D_plus_1 != D + 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"The last dimension of the affine matrix must be D+1.\")\n    \n    # Create an identity matrix of shape (*, 1, D+1)\n    identity_row = torch.zeros(*batch_dims, 1, D_plus_1, dtype=affine_matrix.dtype, device=affine_matrix.device)\n    identity_row[..., -1] = 1  # Set the last element to 1\n    \n    # Concatenate the identity row to the affine matrix\n    homography_matrix = torch.cat((affine_matrix, identity_row), dim=-2)\n    \n    return homography_matrix\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`convert_points_to_homogeneous` Function:**\n   - This function takes a tensor `points` and checks if it is a valid tensor with at least two dimensions.\n   - It appends a column of ones to the last dimension of the input tensor to convert Euclidean coordinates to homogeneous coordinates.\n\n2. **`_convert_affinematrix_to_homography_impl` Function:**\n   - This function takes an affine transformation matrix and converts it into a homography matrix.\n   - It checks the input tensor's validity and ensures the last dimension is `D+1`.\n   - It appends a row `[0, 0, ..., 1]` to the affine matrix to form a homography matrix.\n\nThese functions are designed to work with PyTorch tensors, which are commonly used in machine learning and computer vision applications.",
    "prompt": "Create a function `convert_points_to_homogeneous` that converts Euclidean points to homogeneous coordinates. The function takes a tensor `points` with shape `(*, N, D)` and returns a tensor of shape `(*, N, D+1)` representing the points in homogeneous space. It raises a `TypeError` if the input is not a tensor and a `ValueError` if the input tensor has fewer than two dimensions. Additionally, implement `_convert_affinematrix_to_homography_impl` to transform an affine matrix into a homography matrix, ensuring the correct padding and dimensionality.",
