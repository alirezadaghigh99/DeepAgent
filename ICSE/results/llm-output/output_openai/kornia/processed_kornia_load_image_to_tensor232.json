    "result": "To achieve the task of loading an image file, decoding it using Kornia's Rust backend, and converting it to a PyTorch tensor, we need to ensure that we have the necessary libraries installed and properly configured. Kornia is a computer vision library for PyTorch that provides efficient image processing operations, and it can leverage Rust for some backend operations. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Kornia does not natively support a Rust backend for image decoding directly in its API. Instead, Kornia typically relies on PyTorch and other Python libraries for image processing.\n\nFor this task, we will use Kornia's image processing capabilities along with PyTorch to load and process the image. We will use the `PIL` library to handle image file reading and decoding, as it is a common practice in the PyTorch ecosystem. Here's how you can implement the `_load_image_to_tensor` function:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\n\ndef _load_image_to_tensor(path_file: Path, device: torch.device) -> torch.Tensor:\n    # Check if the file exists\n    if not path_file.exists():\n        raise FileNotFoundError(f\"The file {path_file} does not exist.\")\n    \n    # Check if the file extension is supported\n    if path_file.suffix.lower() not in ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.bmp', '.tiff']:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Unsupported image format: {path_file.suffix}\")\n    \n    # Open the image file\n    with Image.open(path_file) as img:\n        # Convert the image to RGB (if not already in that mode)\n        img = img.convert('RGB')\n        \n        # Define the transformation to convert the image to a tensor\n        transform = transforms.Compose([\n            transforms.ToTensor()  # Converts the image to a tensor with shape (C, H, W) and scales pixel values to [0, 1]\n        ])\n        \n        # Apply the transformation\n        img_tensor = transform(img)\n        \n        # Move the tensor to the specified device\n        img_tensor = img_tensor.to(device)\n    \n    return img_tensor\n\n# Example usage:\n# path = Path(\"path/to/your/image.jpg\")\n# device = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\n# image_tensor = _load_image_to_tensor(path, device)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **File Existence and Format Check**: The function first checks if the specified file exists and if its format is supported. It raises appropriate errors if these conditions are not met.\n\n2. **Image Loading and Conversion**: The `PIL` library is used to open the image file. The image is converted to RGB mode to ensure consistency in the number of channels.\n\n3. **Transformation to Tensor**: We use `torchvision.transforms` to convert the image to a PyTorch tensor. The `ToTensor` transform scales the pixel values to the range [0, 1] and changes the shape to (C, H, W).\n\n4. **Device Transfer**: Finally, the tensor is moved to the specified device (CPU or GPU).\n\nThis function should work for most common image formats and efficiently load images into PyTorch for further processing.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function `_load_image_to_tensor` that reads an image file from the specified `path_file`, decodes it using the Kornia Rust backend, and converts it to a PyTorch tensor. The function takes two inputs: `path_file`, which is a `Path` object pointing to a valid image file, and `device`, which specifies the device (e.g., CPU or GPU) where the image tensor should be placed. The function returns the image as a tensor with shape `(3, H, W)`, where `H` is the height and `W` is the width of the image. The function handles image files with `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and other supported formats, raising an error if the image format is unsupported. It also ensures that the resulting tensor is moved to the specified device.",
