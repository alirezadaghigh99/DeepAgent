    "result": "To implement the `get_perspective_transform` function using the Direct Linear Transform (DLT) algorithm, we need to solve a system of linear equations to find the perspective transformation matrix. This matrix maps the source points to the destination points. Here's how you can implement this in Python using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef get_perspective_transform(points_src, points_dst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate a perspective transform from four pairs of the corresponding points using DLT.\n\n    Args:\n        points_src: coordinates of quadrangle vertices in the source image with shape (B, 4, 2).\n        points_dst: coordinates of the corresponding quadrangle vertices in the destination image with shape (B, 4, 2).\n\n    Returns:\n        The perspective transformation with shape (B, 3, 3).\n    \"\"\"\n    assert points_src.shape == points_dst.shape, \"Source and destination points must have the same shape\"\n    assert points_src.shape[1:] == (4, 2), \"Each set of points must have shape (4, 2)\"\n\n    batch_size = points_src.shape[0]\n    A = torch.zeros((batch_size, 8, 8), dtype=points_src.dtype, device=points_src.device)\n    b = torch.zeros((batch_size, 8, 1), dtype=points_src.dtype, device=points_src.device)\n\n    for i in range(4):\n        x_src, y_src = points_src[:, i, 0], points_src[:, i, 1]\n        x_dst, y_dst = points_dst[:, i, 0], points_dst[:, i, 1]\n\n        A[:, 2 * i, 0] = x_src\n        A[:, 2 * i, 1] = y_src\n        A[:, 2 * i, 2] = 1\n        A[:, 2 * i, 6] = -x_src * x_dst\n        A[:, 2 * i, 7] = -y_src * x_dst\n        b[:, 2 * i, 0] = x_dst\n\n        A[:, 2 * i + 1, 3] = x_src\n        A[:, 2 * i + 1, 4] = y_src\n        A[:, 2 * i + 1, 5] = 1\n        A[:, 2 * i + 1, 6] = -x_src * y_dst\n        A[:, 2 * i + 1, 7] = -y_src * y_dst\n        b[:, 2 * i + 1, 0] = y_dst\n\n    # Solve the system Ax = b\n    h = torch.linalg.solve(A, b)\n\n    # Append 1 to the end of each h to form the 3x3 matrix\n    h = torch.cat([h, torch.ones((batch_size, 1, 1), dtype=points_src.dtype, device=points_src.device)], dim=1)\n    h = h.view(batch_size, 3, 3)\n\n    return h\n\n# Example usage\nx1 = torch.tensor([[[0., 0.], [1., 0.], [1., 1.], [0., 1.]]])\nx2 = torch.tensor([[[1., 0.], [0., 0.], [0., 1.], [1., 1.]]])\nx2_trans_x1 = get_perspective_transform(x1, x2)\nprint(x2_trans_x1)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Validation**: The function checks that the input shapes are correct.\n- **Matrix Construction**: For each pair of points, two rows are added to the matrix `A` and the vector `b` to represent the linear equations derived from the perspective transformation equations.\n- **Solving the System**: The system of equations `Ax = b` is solved using `torch.linalg.solve` to find the transformation parameters.\n- **Matrix Formation**: The solution vector `h` is reshaped into a 3x3 matrix by appending a 1 to the end, which corresponds to the bottom-right element of the perspective transformation matrix.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input tensors are on the same device and have the same data type. Adjustments may be needed if you are working with different devices or data types.",
