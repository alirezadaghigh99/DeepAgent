    "result": "To calculate the Jensen-Shannon divergence loss between two heatmaps, we need to compute the divergence between the predicted and target distributions. The Jensen-Shannon divergence is a symmetric and smoothed version of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. It is defined as the average of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between each distribution and the average distribution.\n\nHere's a Python function `js_div_loss_2d` that implements this calculation using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef js_div_loss_2d(pred, target, reduction='mean'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Jensen-Shannon divergence loss between two heatmaps.\n\n    Args:\n        pred (torch.Tensor): Predicted tensor with shape (B, N, H, W).\n        target (torch.Tensor): Target tensor with shape (B, N, H, W).\n        reduction (str): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output: 'none', 'mean', or 'sum'.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: The calculated loss.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure the input tensors are probability distributions\n    pred = F.softmax(pred, dim=-1)\n    target = F.softmax(target, dim=-1)\n\n    # Calculate the average distribution\n    m = 0.5 * (pred + target)\n\n    # Calculate the Kullback-Leibler divergence\n    kl_pred_m = F.kl_div(pred.log(), m, reduction='none')\n    kl_target_m = F.kl_div(target.log(), m, reduction='none')\n\n    # Calculate the Jensen-Shannon divergence\n    js_div = 0.5 * (kl_pred_m + kl_target_m)\n\n    # Apply the specified reduction\n    if reduction == 'mean':\n        return js_div.mean()\n    elif reduction == 'sum':\n        return js_div.sum()\n    elif reduction == 'none':\n        return js_div\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Invalid reduction type: {reduction}. Choose from 'none', 'mean', or 'sum'.\")\n\n# Example usage\npred = torch.full((1, 1, 2, 4), 0.125)\nloss = js_div_loss_2d(pred, pred)\nprint(loss.item())  # Should return 0.0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Softmax**: We apply the softmax function to ensure that the input tensors are treated as probability distributions.\n- **Average Distribution**: We compute the average distribution `m` as the mean of `pred` and `target`.\n- **KL Divergence**: We calculate the Kullback-Leibler divergence between `pred` and `m`, and between `target` and `m`.\n- **Jensen-Shannon Divergence**: The JS divergence is the average of the two KL divergences.\n- **Reduction**: We apply the specified reduction method to the final loss tensor.\n\nThis function should work as expected for calculating the Jensen-Shannon divergence loss between two 2D heatmaps.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called js_div_loss_2d that calculates the Jensen-Shannon divergence loss between two heatmaps. The function takes three arguments: pred (input tensor with shape (B, N, H, W)), target (target tensor with shape (B, N, H, W)), and reduction (specifies the reduction to apply to the output: 'none', 'mean', or 'sum'). The function returns a tensor.\n\nExample usage:\npred = torch.full((1, 1, 2, 4), 0.125)\nloss = js_div_loss_2d(pred, pred)\nloss.item() should return 0.0.",
