    "result": "To implement the `forward` method for the `Rot180` class, we need to rotate the input tensor by 180 degrees. This involves flipping the tensor both vertically and horizontally. In PyTorch, this can be efficiently achieved using tensor slicing.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `forward` method:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom torch.nn import Module\n\nclass Rot180(Module):\n    def forward(self, input: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # Reverse the height and width dimensions\n        return input.flip(-1).flip(-2)\n\n# Explanation:\n# - `flip(-1)` flips the last dimension, which corresponds to the width (W).\n# - `flip(-2)` flips the second to last dimension, which corresponds to the height (H).\n# - This combination effectively rotates the tensor by 180 degrees.\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Tensor Dimensions**:\n   - The input tensor can be of shape `(C, H, W)` for a single image or `(*, C, H, W)` for a batch of images, where `*` can be any number of leading dimensions (e.g., batch size).\n\n2. **Flipping**:\n   - `flip(-1)`: This operation flips the last dimension, which is the width (W) of the image.\n   - `flip(-2)`: This operation flips the second-to-last dimension, which is the height (H) of the image.\n   - By flipping both the height and width, the image is effectively rotated by 180 degrees.\n\n3. **Efficiency**:\n   - Using `flip` is efficient and leverages PyTorch's optimized operations for tensor manipulation.\n\nThis implementation will correctly rotate any input tensor by 180 degrees, whether it's a single image or a batch of images.",
