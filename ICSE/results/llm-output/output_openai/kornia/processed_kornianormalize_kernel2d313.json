    "result": "To complete the `normalize_kernel2d` function, we need to normalize a 2D kernel. Normalization typically involves ensuring that the sum of all elements in the kernel equals 1. This is often done for smoothing kernels to ensure that the overall intensity of the image remains unchanged after convolution. For derivative kernels, normalization might involve ensuring that the sum of absolute values equals 1, or some other criteria depending on the specific application.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of the `normalize_kernel2d` function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\n\ndef KORNIA_CHECK_SHAPE(input: Tensor, shape: list):\n    # This is a placeholder for the actual shape checking function.\n    # You would replace this with the actual implementation or import.\n    assert len(input.shape) == len(shape), \"Input tensor does not match the expected shape.\"\n    for dim, expected in zip(input.shape, shape):\n        if expected != \"*\":\n            assert dim == expected, f\"Expected dimension {expected}, but got {dim}.\"\n\ndef normalize_kernel2d(input: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n    r\"\"\"Normalize both derivative and smoothing kernel.\"\"\"\n    KORNIA_CHECK_SHAPE(input, [\"*\", \"H\", \"W\"])\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the absolute values of the kernel\n    abs_sum = input.abs().sum(dim=(-2, -1), keepdim=True)\n    \n    # Normalize the kernel by dividing by the sum of absolute values\n    normalized_kernel = input / abs_sum\n    \n    return normalized_kernel\n\n# Example usage:\n# kernel = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])\n# normalized_kernel = normalize_kernel2d(kernel)\n# print(normalized_kernel)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Shape Check**: The `KORNIA_CHECK_SHAPE` function is a placeholder to ensure the input tensor has the expected shape. In this example, it checks that the input tensor has at least two dimensions, `H` and `W`.\n\n2. **Normalization**: The function calculates the sum of the absolute values of the kernel elements. This is done to handle both derivative and smoothing kernels, as derivative kernels might have negative values.\n\n3. **Division**: The kernel is normalized by dividing each element by the sum of the absolute values, ensuring that the sum of the absolute values of the normalized kernel is 1.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input tensor is at least 2D, with the last two dimensions representing the height and width of the kernel. Adjustments might be needed based on specific requirements or additional dimensions in the input tensor.",
