    "result": "To calculate the Average Endpoint Error (AEPE) between two flow maps in Python, you can use the following function. This function uses PyTorch for tensor operations, which is suitable for handling multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. The function takes two flow maps as input and computes the AEPE based on the specified reduction method.\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef aepe(input: torch.Tensor, target: torch.Tensor, reduction: str = 'mean') -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Average Endpoint Error (AEPE) between two flow maps.\n\n    Args:\n        input (torch.Tensor): The input flow map with shape (*, 2).\n        target (torch.Tensor): The target flow map with shape (*, 2).\n        reduction (str): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output: 'none' | 'mean' | 'sum'.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: The computed AEPE as a scalar or tensor based on the reduction method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure the input and target have the same shape\n    if input.shape != target.shape:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input and target must have the same shape.\")\n\n    # Calculate the squared differences\n    diff = input - target\n    squared_diff = diff ** 2\n\n    # Sum the squared differences along the last dimension (2D vectors)\n    sum_squared_diff = squared_diff.sum(dim=-1)\n\n    # Calculate the square root of the sum of squared differences\n    endpoint_error = torch.sqrt(sum_squared_diff)\n\n    # Apply the specified reduction method\n    if reduction == 'none':\n        return endpoint_error\n    elif reduction == 'mean':\n        return endpoint_error.mean()\n    elif reduction == 'sum':\n        return endpoint_error.sum()\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Reduction must be one of 'none', 'mean', or 'sum'.\")\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    ones = torch.ones(4, 4, 2)\n    result = aepe(ones, 1.2 * ones)\n    print(result)  # Output: tensor(0.2828)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the input and target tensors have the same shape.\n- **Difference Calculation**: It computes the difference between the input and target flow maps.\n- **Squared Differences**: The squared differences are calculated for each component of the 2D vectors.\n- **Sum and Square Root**: The sum of squared differences is computed along the last dimension, and then the square root is taken to get the endpoint error.\n- **Reduction**: The function supports three types of reduction: 'none', 'mean', and 'sum'. Depending on the reduction method, it returns the appropriate result.\n\nThis function is flexible and can be used for various applications involving optical flow or similar 2D vector fields.",
