    "result": "To create the `convert_points_from_homogeneous` function, we need to handle the conversion of points from homogeneous coordinates to Euclidean coordinates. In homogeneous coordinates, each point is represented with an extra dimension, typically used for projective geometry. To convert these points to Euclidean space, we divide each coordinate by the last coordinate of the point.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function in Python using a library like PyTorch for tensor operations:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef convert_points_from_homogeneous(points, eps=1e-10):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert points from homogeneous to Euclidean space.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - points (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, N, D) representing points in homogeneous coordinates.\n    - eps (float): A small value to avoid division by zero.\n\n    Returns:\n    - torch.Tensor: A tensor of shape (B, N, D-1) representing points in Euclidean space.\n\n    Raises:\n    - TypeError: If the input is not a tensor.\n    - ValueError: If the input tensor has fewer than two dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(points, torch.Tensor):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a torch.Tensor\")\n    \n    if points.dim() < 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input tensor must have at least two dimensions\")\n    \n    # Extract the last dimension (homogeneous coordinate)\n    last_coord = points[..., -1:]\n    \n    # Avoid division by zero by adding eps\n    last_coord = last_coord.clamp(min=eps)\n    \n    # Divide all but the last coordinate by the last coordinate\n    euclidean_points = points[..., :-1] / last_coord\n    \n    return euclidean_points\n\n# Example usage:\n# points = torch.tensor([[[1.0, 2.0, 1.0], [3.0, 4.0, 2.0]]])\n# euclidean_points = convert_points_from_homogeneous(points)\n# print(euclidean_points)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**:\n   - We first check if the input `points` is a `torch.Tensor`. If not, a `TypeError` is raised.\n   - We then check if the tensor has at least two dimensions. If not, a `ValueError` is raised.\n\n2. **Homogeneous to Euclidean Conversion**:\n   - We extract the last coordinate of each point using `points[..., -1:]`. This is the homogeneous coordinate.\n   - To prevent division by zero, we use `clamp(min=eps)` to ensure that the last coordinate is at least `eps`.\n   - We divide all coordinates except the last one by the last coordinate to convert to Euclidean space.\n\n3. **Return**:\n   - The function returns the converted points in Euclidean space with shape `(B, N, D-1)`.\n\nThis function should work efficiently with PyTorch tensors and handle edge cases like division by zero gracefully.",
    "prompt": "Create a function `convert_points_from_homogeneous` that converts points from homogeneous to Euclidean space. The function takes a tensor `points` with shape `(B, N, D)` and an optional `eps` parameter to avoid division by zero. It returns a tensor of shape `(B, N, D-1)` representing the points in Euclidean space. A `TypeError` is raised if the input is not a tensor, and a `ValueError` is raised if the input tensor has fewer than two dimensions.",
