    "result": "To create the `unproject_points_z1` function, we need to understand the concept of unprojecting points from a canonical plane (z=1) into the camera frame. The points on the z=1 plane are given in 2D coordinates, and we want to convert them into 3D coordinates in the camera frame. The optional `extension` tensor represents the depth of these points, which allows us to scale the points accordingly.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `unproject_points_z1` function in Python using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef unproject_points_z1(points_in_cam_canonical, extension=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Unprojects points from the canonical z=1 plane into the camera frame.\n\n    Args:\n        points_in_cam_canonical (Tensor): A tensor of shape (..., 2) representing the points to unproject.\n        extension (Tensor, optional): A tensor of shape (..., 1) representing the extension (depth) of the points.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor: A tensor of shape (..., 3) representing the unprojected points.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure points_in_cam_canonical is a tensor\n    points_in_cam_canonical = torch.as_tensor(points_in_cam_canonical, dtype=torch.float32)\n\n    # If extension is not provided, assume it to be 1 (i.e., no scaling)\n    if extension is None:\n        extension = torch.ones(points_in_cam_canonical.shape[:-1] + (1,), dtype=torch.float32)\n\n    # Ensure extension is a tensor\n    extension = torch.as_tensor(extension, dtype=torch.float32)\n\n    # Calculate the unprojected points\n    unprojected_points = torch.cat((points_in_cam_canonical * extension, extension), dim=-1)\n\n    return unprojected_points\n\n# Example usage\npoints = torch.tensor([[0.5, 0.5], [1.0, 1.0]])\nextension = torch.tensor([[2.0], [3.0]])\nunprojected_points = unproject_points_z1(points, extension)\nprint(unprojected_points)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Tensors**:\n   - `points_in_cam_canonical`: A tensor of shape (..., 2) representing 2D points on the z=1 plane.\n   - `extension`: An optional tensor of shape (..., 1) representing the depth or scaling factor for each point.\n\n2. **Default Extension**:\n   - If `extension` is not provided, it defaults to 1, meaning no scaling is applied, and the points are assumed to be at z=1.\n\n3. **Unprojection Calculation**:\n   - The 2D points are scaled by the `extension` to get their x and y coordinates in the 3D space.\n   - The z-coordinate is directly taken from the `extension`, as it represents the depth.\n\n4. **Output Tensor**:\n   - The function returns a tensor of shape (..., 3) representing the unprojected 3D points in the camera frame.\n\nThis function is flexible and can handle batches of points due to its use of broadcasting and tensor operations.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called unproject_points_z1 that unprojects one or more points from the canonical z=1 plane into the camera frame. The function takes in a Tensor called points_in_cam_canonical representing the points to unproject with shape (..., 2) and an optional Tensor called extension representing the extension (depth) of the points with shape (..., 1). The function returns a Tensor representing the unprojected points with shape (..., 3). An example usage of the function is provided where points and extension are tensors, and the output is a tensor of unprojected points.",
