    "result": "To create a Python class called `EncodeImages` that generates hashes for images in a specified directory, we can use the `imagededup` library, which provides various hashing methods for image deduplication. Below is an implementation of the `EncodeImages` class with the specified `encode_images` method. This method will utilize multiprocessing to speed up the hashing process if desired.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom multiprocessing import cpu_count, Pool\nfrom imagededup.methods import PHash  # You can replace PHash with any other hash method from imagededup\nfrom typing import Dict, Optional, List, Tuple\n\nclass EncodeImages:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.hasher = PHash()  # Initialize the hash method. Replace PHash with another method if needed.\n\n    def _get_image_files(self, image_dir: str, recursive: bool) -> List[str]:\n        \"\"\"Helper method to get a list of image file paths.\"\"\"\n        image_files = []\n        for root, _, files in os.walk(image_dir):\n            for file in files:\n                if file.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.bmp', '.gif', '.tiff')):\n                    image_files.append(os.path.join(root, file))\n            if not recursive:\n                break\n        return image_files\n\n    def _encode_single_image(self, image_path: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:\n        \"\"\"Helper method to encode a single image and return its filename and hash.\"\"\"\n        try:\n            hash_string = self.hasher.encode_image(image_file=image_path)\n            return os.path.basename(image_path), hash_string\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Error encoding {image_path}: {e}\")\n            return os.path.basename(image_path), None\n\n    def encode_images(self, image_dir: Optional[str] = None, recursive: bool = False, num_enc_workers: int = cpu_count()) -> Dict[str, str]:\n        \"\"\"Generate hashes for all images in a given directory.\"\"\"\n        if image_dir is None:\n            raise ValueError(\"image_dir must be specified.\")\n\n        image_files = self._get_image_files(image_dir, recursive)\n        if not image_files:\n            print(\"No images found in the specified directory.\")\n            return {}\n\n        if num_enc_workers == 0:\n            # Single-threaded processing\n            results = [self._encode_single_image(image_path) for image_path in image_files]\n        else:\n            # Multi-threaded processing\n            with Pool(processes=num_enc_workers) as pool:\n                results = pool.map(self._encode_single_image, image_files)\n\n        # Filter out any None results due to errors\n        return {filename: hash_string for filename, hash_string in results if hash_string is not None}\n\n# Example usage:\n# myencoder = EncodeImages()\n# mapping = myencoder.encode_images('path/to/directory')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**: The class initializes with a specific hashing method from the `imagededup` library. You can replace `PHash` with any other hashing method provided by the library.\n- **_get_image_files**: This helper method retrieves all image files from the specified directory, optionally searching recursively.\n- **_encode_single_image**: This helper method encodes a single image and returns its filename and hash.\n- **encode_images**: This method orchestrates the process, using either single-threaded or multi-threaded processing based on the `num_enc_workers` parameter. It returns a dictionary mapping filenames to their hash strings.\n\nThis implementation provides a flexible and efficient way to generate image hashes, leveraging multiprocessing to handle large directories of images.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python class called encode_images with the following methods:\n- encode_images(self, image_dir=None, recursive: bool = False, num_enc_workers: int = cpu_count())\n\nThe encode_images method generates hashes for all images in a given directory of images. It takes three arguments:\n- image_dir: Path to the image directory.\n- recursive: Optional, find images recursively in a nested image directory structure, set to False by default.\n- num_enc_workers: Optional, number of CPU cores to use for multiprocessing encoding generation, set to the number of CPUs in the system by default. 0 disables multiprocessing.\n\nThe method returns a dictionary that contains a mapping of filenames and corresponding 64-character hash strings, such as {'Image1.jpg': 'hash_string1', 'Image2.jpg': 'hash_string2', ...}\n\nExample usage:\n```\nfrom imagededup.methods import <hash-method>\nmyencoder = <hash-method>()\nmapping = myencoder.encode_images('path/to/directory')\n```",
