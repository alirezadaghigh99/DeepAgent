    "result": "To calculate the Hamming distance between two hash strings, we need to compare them bit by bit and count the number of positions where the bits differ. If the hashes are not 64 bits long, we will pad them to 64 bits. Here's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef hamming_distance(hash1: str, hash2: str) -> float:\n    # Ensure both hashes are 64 bits long by padding with zeros if necessary\n    hash1 = hash1.ljust(64, '0')\n    hash2 = hash2.ljust(64, '0')\n    \n    # Calculate the Hamming distance\n    distance = sum(c1 != c2 for c1, c2 in zip(hash1, hash2))\n    \n    return float(distance)\n\n# Example usage:\nhash1 = \"1101\"\nhash2 = \"1001\"\nprint(hamming_distance(hash1, hash2))  # Output: 1.0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Padding**: We use the `ljust` method to pad each hash to 64 characters with '0's. This ensures that both strings are 64 bits long before comparison.\n\n2. **Hamming Distance Calculation**: We use a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over pairs of characters from `hash1` and `hash2`. For each pair, we check if the characters are different (`c1 != c2`). The `sum` function then counts the number of `True` values, which corresponds to the number of differing bits.\n\n3. **Return Value**: The function returns the Hamming distance as a float, as specified.\n\nThis function assumes that the input strings are binary strings (composed of '0's and '1's). If the input strings can contain other characters, additional validation would be necessary.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called hamming_distance that calculates the Hamming distance between two hash strings. The function takes two input parameters, hash1 and hash2, both of type string. The function returns a float value representing the Hamming distance between the two hashes. If the length of the hashes is not 64 bits, the function pads the length to be 64 for each hash before calculating the Hamming distance. The output is the calculated Hamming distance between the two hashes.",
