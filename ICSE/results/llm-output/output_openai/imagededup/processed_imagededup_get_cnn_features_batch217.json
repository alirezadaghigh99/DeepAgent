    "result": "To create the `_get_cnn_features_batch` method, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: We'll use libraries such as `torch`, `torchvision`, and `numpy` for handling images and generating CNN features. We'll also use `pathlib` for handling file paths and `logging` for logging information.\n\n2. **Set Up Logging**: We'll configure logging to provide information about the process.\n\n3. **Load Images**: We'll use `torchvision.datasets` and `torchvision.transforms` to load and preprocess images.\n\n4. **Initialize a DataLoader**: This will help in efficiently loading images in batches, especially useful when dealing with a large number of images.\n\n5. **Load a Pre-trained CNN Model**: We'll use a pre-trained model from `torchvision.models` to generate features.\n\n6. **Process Images and Handle Exceptions**: We'll iterate over the images, process them through the model, and handle any exceptions that occur due to bad images.\n\n7. **Return a Dictionary of Features**: Finally, we'll return a dictionary mapping each image filename to its corresponding CNN feature vector.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\nimport torchvision.models as models\nfrom torchvision.datasets import ImageFolder\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\nfrom pathlib import PurePath\nfrom typing import Optional, Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport logging\nimport os\n\ndef _get_cnn_features_batch(image_dir: PurePath, recursive: Optional[bool] = False, num_workers: int = 0) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    # Set up logging\n    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n    # Define image transformations\n    transform = transforms.Compose([\n        transforms.Resize((224, 224)),\n        transforms.ToTensor(),\n        transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),\n    ])\n\n    # Load images\n    try:\n        dataset = ImageFolder(root=str(image_dir), transform=transform)\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error loading images from directory {image_dir}: {e}\")\n        return {}\n\n    # Initialize DataLoader\n    data_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=False, num_workers=num_workers)\n\n    # Load a pre-trained CNN model\n    model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)\n    model.eval()\n\n    # Remove the final classification layer to get features\n    model = torch.nn.Sequential(*(list(model.children())[:-1]))\n\n    # Dictionary to store features\n    features_dict = {}\n\n    # Process images\n    with torch.no_grad():\n        for inputs, _ in data_loader:\n            try:\n                outputs = model(inputs)\n                outputs = outputs.view(outputs.size(0), -1)  # Flatten the output\n\n                # Map filenames to features\n                for i, (path, _) in enumerate(data_loader.dataset.samples):\n                    filename = os.path.basename(path)\n                    features_dict[filename] = outputs[i].numpy()\n\n            except Exception as e:\n                logger.warning(f\"Error processing batch: {e}\")\n\n    logger.info(\"Feature extraction completed.\")\n    return features_dict\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Logging**: Provides information about the process and warns about any issues encountered.\n- **DataLoader**: Efficiently loads images in batches, which is crucial for handling large datasets.\n- **Model**: Uses a pre-trained ResNet-50 model, which is a common choice for feature extraction.\n- **Error Handling**: Catches and logs errors that occur during image processing, ensuring that the process continues even if some images are problematic.\n\nThis method should be able to handle a directory of images, process them to extract CNN features, and return a dictionary mapping filenames to their respective feature vectors.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method called `_get_cnn_features_batch` that takes in parameters `image_dir` of type `PurePath`, `recursive` of type `Optional[bool]` with a default value of `False`, and `num_workers` of type `int` with a default value of `0`. The method returns a dictionary mapping filenames to corresponding numpy arrays of CNN encodings.\n\nThe method generates CNN encodings for all images in a given directory of images. It initializes a data loader, processes the images using a model, and creates a dictionary mapping filenames to their respective encodings. The method handles bad images and provides logging information throughout the process.",
