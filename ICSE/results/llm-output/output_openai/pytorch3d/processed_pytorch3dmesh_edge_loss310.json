    "result": "To implement the `mesh_edge_loss` function, we need to compute the regularization loss for the edge lengths of a batch of meshes. The loss is based on the squared difference between the actual edge lengths and a target length, with each mesh contributing equally to the final loss. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom pytorch3d.structures import Meshes\n\ndef mesh_edge_loss(meshes: Meshes, target_length: float) -> torch.Tensor:\n    # Check if the meshes object is empty\n    if len(meshes) == 0:\n        return torch.tensor(0.0, dtype=torch.float32)\n\n    # Initialize the total loss\n    total_loss = 0.0\n\n    # Get the number of meshes in the batch\n    num_meshes = len(meshes)\n\n    # Iterate over each mesh in the batch\n    for mesh in meshes:\n        # Get the edges of the mesh\n        edges = mesh.edges_packed()\n        \n        # Get the vertices of the mesh\n        verts = mesh.verts_packed()\n        \n        # Calculate the edge lengths\n        edge_lengths = torch.norm(verts[edges[:, 0]] - verts[edges[:, 1]], dim=1)\n        \n        # Calculate the number of edges in the current mesh\n        num_edges = len(edge_lengths)\n        \n        # Calculate the weight for each edge\n        edge_weight = 1.0 / num_edges\n        \n        # Calculate the loss for the current mesh\n        mesh_loss = edge_weight * torch.sum((edge_lengths - target_length) ** 2)\n        \n        # Add the mesh loss to the total loss\n        total_loss += mesh_loss\n\n    # Average the total loss across all meshes\n    average_loss = total_loss / num_meshes\n\n    return average_loss\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Check for Empty Meshes**: If the `meshes` object is empty, return a tensor with a value of 0.0.\n\n2. **Initialize Total Loss**: Start with a total loss of 0.0.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Meshes**: For each mesh in the batch, perform the following steps:\n\n   - **Get Edges and Vertices**: Use `edges_packed()` to get the edges and `verts_packed()` to get the vertices of the mesh.\n\n   - **Compute Edge Lengths**: Calculate the length of each edge using the Euclidean distance between its vertices.\n\n   - **Compute Edge Weight**: The weight for each edge is the inverse of the number of edges in the mesh.\n\n   - **Compute Mesh Loss**: Calculate the squared difference between each edge length and the target length, multiply by the edge weight, and sum these values to get the loss for the current mesh.\n\n4. **Average Loss**: Divide the total loss by the number of meshes to get the average loss across the batch.\n\n5. **Return the Average Loss**: Return the computed average loss as a tensor.\n\nThis function ensures that each mesh contributes equally to the final loss, regardless of the number of edges it contains.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called mesh_edge_loss that computes the mesh edge length regularization loss averaged across all meshes in a batch. The function takes in two arguments: meshes (a Meshes object with a batch of meshes) and target_length (a float representing the resting value for the edge length). \n\nThe function calculates the average loss across the batch, where each mesh contributes equally to the final loss, regardless of the number of edges per mesh. Each mesh is weighted with the inverse number of edges, so that meshes with fewer edges have a higher impact on the final loss.\n\nIf the input meshes object is empty, the function returns a tensor with a value of 0.0. Otherwise, the function computes the loss by determining the weight for each edge based on the number of edges in the corresponding mesh. The loss is calculated as the squared difference between the edge length and the target length, multiplied by the weights. \n\nFinally, the function returns the sum of the weighted losses divided by the total number of meshes in the batch.",
