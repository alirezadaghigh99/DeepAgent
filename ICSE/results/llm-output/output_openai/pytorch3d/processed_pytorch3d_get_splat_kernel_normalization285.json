    "result": "To implement the `_get_splat_kernel_normalization` function, we need to perform a series of operations on the `offsets` tensor and the `sigma` value. The function will compute a normalization constant using the exponential of the negative squared values of `offsets`, scaled by `sigma`. Here's how you can implement this function in Python using the PyTorch library for tensor operations:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _get_splat_kernel_normalization(offsets, sigma=0.5):\n    if sigma <= 0.0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Sigma must be greater than 0.0\")\n    \n    # Calculate the squared offsets\n    squared_offsets = offsets ** 2\n    \n    # Calculate the normalization constant\n    normalization_constant = torch.exp(-squared_offsets / (2 * sigma ** 2)).sum()\n    \n    # Add epsilon to the normalization constant\n    epsilon = 0.05\n    normalization_constant += epsilon\n    \n    # Calculate the normalized value\n    normalized_value = (1 + epsilon) / normalization_constant\n    \n    return normalized_value\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if `sigma` is less than or equal to 0.0 and raises a `ValueError` if so, as a non-positive `sigma` would not be valid for the Gaussian-like operation.\n\n2. **Squared Offsets**: The `offsets` tensor is squared element-wise. This is a common step in Gaussian-like operations where the distance is squared.\n\n3. **Normalization Constant**: The normalization constant is computed using the formula `exp(-squared_offsets / (2 * sigma^2))`. This is a Gaussian-like function applied to each element of the squared offsets, and the results are summed up.\n\n4. **Epsilon Addition**: An epsilon value of 0.05 is added to the normalization constant to ensure that the gradient can flow through non-boundary pixels, which is important for optimization processes in neural networks.\n\n5. **Normalized Value**: Finally, the function returns the normalized value by dividing `(1 + epsilon)` by the normalization constant.\n\nThis function is designed to work with PyTorch tensors, which are commonly used in deep learning applications for their automatic differentiation capabilities.",
    "prompt": "Define a Python function called `_get_splat_kernel_normalization` that takes in a tensor `offsets` and a float `sigma` with a default value of 0.5. If the `sigma` value is less than or equal to 0.0, a ValueError is raised. The function calculates a normalization constant using the formula involving exponential and sum operations on the squared values of the `offsets` tensor. An epsilon value of 0.05 is added to the normalization constant to ensure gradient flow through non-boundary pixels. The function returns a normalized value by dividing (1 + epsilon) by the normalization constant.",
