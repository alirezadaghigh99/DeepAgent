    "result": "To implement the `apply_blurpool_on_weights` function, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Padding**: Pad the input tensor to handle edge cases during pooling.\n2. **Max Pooling**: Apply a 2-tap max filter to the padded weights.\n3. **Blur Filter**: Apply a 2-tap blur filter using linear interpolation to smooth the weights.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef apply_blurpool_on_weights(weights):\n    # Ensure the input is a tensor\n    if not isinstance(weights, torch.Tensor):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input weights must be a torch.Tensor\")\n\n    # Get the original shape\n    original_shape = weights.shape\n\n    # Pad the weights tensor along the last dimension\n    # We use padding of (1, 1) to pad both sides of the last dimension\n    padded_weights = F.pad(weights, (1, 1), mode='replicate')\n\n    # Apply 2-tap max pooling\n    # We use a kernel size of 2 and stride of 1 to get the max filter effect\n    max_pooled_weights = F.max_pool1d(padded_weights.unsqueeze(-2), kernel_size=2, stride=1).squeeze(-2)\n\n    # Apply 2-tap blur filter using linear interpolation\n    # We use a simple average of adjacent elements to achieve the blur effect\n    # This is equivalent to a convolution with a kernel [0.5, 0.5]\n    left = max_pooled_weights[..., :-1]\n    right = max_pooled_weights[..., 1:]\n    blured_weights = 0.5 * (left + right)\n\n    # Since blured_weights is one element shorter in the last dimension, we need to pad it back\n    # We pad one element on the right to match the original shape\n    blured_weights = F.pad(blured_weights, (0, 1), mode='replicate')\n\n    # Ensure the output shape matches the input shape\n    assert blured_weights.shape == original_shape, \"Output shape does not match input shape\"\n\n    return blured_weights\n\n# Example usage:\n# weights = torch.randn(10, 5)  # Example tensor with shape (10, 5)\n# blured_weights = apply_blurpool_on_weights(weights)\n# print(blured_weights)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Padding**: We use `F.pad` with `mode='replicate'` to pad the tensor, which replicates the edge values. This helps in maintaining the boundary values during pooling.\n- **Max Pooling**: We use `F.max_pool1d` with a kernel size of 2 and stride of 1 to apply the max filter.\n- **Blur Filter**: We perform linear interpolation by averaging adjacent elements, which is equivalent to applying a blur filter with a kernel `[0.5, 0.5]`.\n- **Padding Back**: After the blur operation, the result is one element shorter in the last dimension, so we pad it back to match the original shape.\n\nThis function should work for any tensor with shape `(..., dim)`, where `dim` is the last dimension.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called apply_blurpool_on_weights that filters weights with a 2-tap max filter followed by a 2-tap blur filter, producing a wide and smooth upper envelope on the weights. The input is a tensor called weights of shape `(..., dim)` and the output is a tensor called blured_weights of the same shape `(..., dim)`. The function pads the weights, applies max pooling, and then performs linear interpolation to create the blurred weights.",
