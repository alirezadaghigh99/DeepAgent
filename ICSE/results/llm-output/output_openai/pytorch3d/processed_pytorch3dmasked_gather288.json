    "result": "To implement the `masked_gather` function, we need to handle the following steps:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: Ensure that the batch dimensions of `points` and `idx` match. If they don't, raise a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Index Replacement**: Replace `-1` indices in `idx` with `0` to avoid out-of-bounds errors during the gather operation.\n\n3. **Gathering**: Use the modified indices to gather points from the `points` tensor.\n\n4. **Masking**: Set the gathered values corresponding to the original `-1` indices to `0.0`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `masked_gather` function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef masked_gather(points, idx):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gathers points from a tensor based on indices, handling padding indices.\n\n    Args:\n        points (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (batch_size, num_points, point_dim).\n        idx (torch.Tensor): A tensor of indices of shape (batch_size, ...).\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: A tensor of gathered points with the same batch size and shape as idx, \n                      but with an additional dimension for point_dim.\n    \"\"\"\n    if points.size(0) != idx.size(0):\n        raise ValueError(\"Batch dimensions of points and idx must match.\")\n    \n    # Replace -1 indices with 0\n    idx_replaced = idx.clone()\n    idx_replaced[idx_replaced == -1] = 0\n    \n    # Gather points using the modified indices\n    gathered_points = torch.gather(points, 1, idx_replaced.unsqueeze(-1).expand(-1, *idx_replaced.shape[1:], points.size(-1)))\n    \n    # Create a mask for the original -1 indices\n    mask = (idx == -1).unsqueeze(-1).expand_as(gathered_points)\n    \n    # Set gathered values corresponding to original -1 indices to 0.0\n    gathered_points[mask] = 0.0\n    \n    return gathered_points\n\n# Example usage:\n# points = torch.tensor([[[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0]], [[7.0, 8.0], [9.0, 10.0], [11.0, 12.0]]])\n# idx = torch.tensor([[0, 1, -1], [2, -1, 1]])\n# result = masked_gather(points, idx)\n# print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Input Validation**: We check if the batch size (first dimension) of `points` and `idx` are the same. If not, a `ValueError` is raised.\n\n- **Index Replacement**: We clone `idx` to `idx_replaced` and replace all `-1` values with `0`. This ensures that the gather operation does not attempt to access out-of-bounds indices.\n\n- **Gathering**: We use `torch.gather` to collect points from the `points` tensor. The `unsqueeze` and `expand` operations are used to match the dimensions required for gathering.\n\n- **Masking**: We create a mask where the original `-1` indices were located and use this mask to set the corresponding gathered points to `0.0`.\n\nThis function should work efficiently with PyTorch tensors and handle various shapes of `idx` while maintaining the batch dimension integrity.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function `masked_gather` that collects points from a tensor `points` based on indices provided in `idx`, where some indices might be `-1` to indicate padding. The function should replace `-1` indices with `0`, gather the corresponding points, and then set the gathered values corresponding to the original `-1` indices to `0.0`. Ensure that `points` and `idx` have matching batch dimensions, and raise a `ValueError` if they do not. The function should handle different shapes of `idx` and return the gathered points tensor.",
