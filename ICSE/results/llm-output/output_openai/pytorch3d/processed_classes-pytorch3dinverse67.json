    "result": "To implement the `inverse` method for the `Transform3d` class, we need to consider two scenarios based on the `invert_composed` flag:\n\n1. **When `invert_composed` is `True`:** We first compose all the stored transformations into a single transformation matrix and then compute its inverse.\n\n2. **When `invert_composed` is `False`:** We invert each stored transformation individually and then return a new `Transform3d` object with these inverted transformations.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `inverse` method:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Optional, List\n\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: str = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self._matrix = matrix if matrix is not None else torch.eye(4, dtype=dtype, device=device)\n        self._transforms: List[torch.Tensor] = []\n        self.device = device\n        self.dtype = dtype\n\n    def compose(self) -> torch.Tensor:\n        \"\"\"Compose all stored transformations into a single matrix.\"\"\"\n        composed_matrix = self._matrix.clone()\n        for transform in self._transforms:\n            composed_matrix = transform @ composed_matrix\n        return composed_matrix\n\n    def inverse(self, invert_composed: bool = False) -> \"Transform3d\":\n        if invert_composed:\n            # Compose all transformations and then invert the result\n            composed_matrix = self.compose()\n            inverse_matrix = torch.linalg.inv(composed_matrix)\n            return Transform3d(dtype=self.dtype, device=self.device, matrix=inverse_matrix)\n        else:\n            # Invert each transformation individually\n            inverted_transforms = [torch.linalg.inv(transform) for transform in reversed(self._transforms)]\n            inverse_transform = Transform3d(dtype=self.dtype, device=self.device, matrix=torch.eye(4, dtype=self.dtype, device=self.device))\n            inverse_transform._transforms = inverted_transforms\n            return inverse_transform\n\n    def add_transform(self, transform: torch.Tensor):\n        \"\"\"Add a new transformation to the list.\"\"\"\n        self._transforms.append(transform)\n\n# Example usage:\n# transform = Transform3d()\n# transform.add_transform(some_matrix)\n# inverse_transform = transform.inverse(invert_composed=True)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Initialization (`__init__`):** The class initializes with an identity matrix if no matrix is provided. It also maintains a list of transformations (`_transforms`) that can be added using the `add_transform` method.\n\n- **Compose Method:** The `compose` method multiplies all stored transformations to produce a single transformation matrix.\n\n- **Inverse Method:**\n  - If `invert_composed` is `True`, it composes all transformations into a single matrix and then inverts it.\n  - If `invert_composed` is `False`, it inverts each transformation individually and stores them in reverse order in a new `Transform3d` object.\n\n- **Add Transform Method:** This method allows adding new transformation matrices to the list of transformations.\n\nThis implementation efficiently handles both cases of inversion and provides a flexible way to manage 3D transformations.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `inverse` for the `Transform3d` class that returns a new `Transform3d` object representing the inverse of the current transformation. The method should have an argument `invert_composed` which, when set to `True`, first composes the list of stored transformations and then inverts the result, and when set to `False`, inverts the individual stored transformations independently without composing them. The method should efficiently handle both cases, returning a new `Transform3d` object containing the inverse of the original transformation.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: Device = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self._matrix = ...\n        self._transforms = []\n        self.device = ...\n        self.dtype = ...\n\n    def inverse(self, invert_composed: bool = False) -> \"Transform3d\":\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
