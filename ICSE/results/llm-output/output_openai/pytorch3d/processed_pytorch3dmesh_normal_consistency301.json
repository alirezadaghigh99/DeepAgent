    "result": "To compute the normal consistency of each mesh in a batch, we need to consider the angles between the normals of neighboring faces. The normal consistency is a measure of how aligned the normals of adjacent faces are, which can be useful for assessing the smoothness of a mesh.\n\nHere's a Python function `mesh_normal_consistency` that takes a `Meshes` object as input and returns the average normal consistency across the batch. This function assumes that the `Meshes` object is from the PyTorch3D library, which provides efficient handling of 3D data.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom pytorch3d.structures import Meshes\nfrom pytorch3d.ops import face_areas_normals\n\ndef mesh_normal_consistency(meshes: Meshes) -> float:\n    if len(meshes) == 0:\n        return 0.0\n\n    # Get the faces and vertices from the Meshes object\n    verts_list = meshes.verts_list()\n    faces_list = meshes.faces_list()\n\n    total_consistency = 0.0\n    total_edges = 0\n\n    for verts, faces in zip(verts_list, faces_list):\n        if len(faces) == 0:\n            continue\n\n        # Compute face normals\n        _, face_normals = face_areas_normals(verts, faces)\n\n        # Create a dictionary to store edges and their corresponding face indices\n        edge_to_faces = {}\n\n        # Iterate over each face to populate the edge_to_faces dictionary\n        for i, face in enumerate(faces):\n            for j in range(3):\n                # Get the edge as a tuple of vertex indices\n                edge = tuple(sorted((face[j].item(), face[(j + 1) % 3].item())))\n                if edge not in edge_to_faces:\n                    edge_to_faces[edge] = []\n                edge_to_faces[edge].append(i)\n\n        # Calculate normal consistency for each edge\n        for edge, face_indices in edge_to_faces.items():\n            if len(face_indices) < 2:\n                continue  # Skip edges that are not shared by at least two faces\n\n            # Compute the normal consistency for this edge\n            normal_consistency = 0.0\n            for k in range(len(face_indices)):\n                for l in range(k + 1, len(face_indices)):\n                    normal1 = face_normals[face_indices[k]]\n                    normal2 = face_normals[face_indices[l]]\n                    # Compute the cosine of the angle between the two normals\n                    cos_angle = torch.dot(normal1, normal2) / (torch.norm(normal1) * torch.norm(normal2))\n                    # Clamp the cosine value to avoid numerical issues\n                    cos_angle = torch.clamp(cos_angle, -1.0, 1.0)\n                    # Convert to angle and compute consistency\n                    angle = torch.acos(cos_angle)\n                    normal_consistency += (1.0 - angle / torch.pi)\n\n            # Average the consistency over all pairs of faces sharing this edge\n            normal_consistency /= (len(face_indices) * (len(face_indices) - 1) / 2)\n            total_consistency += normal_consistency\n            total_edges += 1\n\n    if total_edges == 0:\n        return 0.0\n\n    # Return the average normal consistency across all edges in the batch\n    return total_consistency / total_edges\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The function first checks if the input `Meshes` object is empty. If so, it returns 0.0.\n\n2. **Face Normals Calculation**: It uses `face_areas_normals` from PyTorch3D to compute the normals for each face in the mesh.\n\n3. **Edge to Faces Mapping**: It constructs a dictionary that maps each edge to the list of face indices that share this edge.\n\n4. **Normal Consistency Calculation**: For each edge shared by at least two faces, it calculates the normal consistency by computing the angle between the normals of the faces sharing the edge. The consistency is based on how close the angle is to zero (i.e., how aligned the normals are).\n\n5. **Average Consistency**: Finally, it computes the average normal consistency across all edges in the batch and returns it.\n\nThis function efficiently handles the computation of normal consistency by leveraging the data structures and operations provided by PyTorch3D.",
    "prompt": "Define a Python function called mesh_normal_consistency that computes the normal consistency of each mesh in a batch of meshes. The function takes a Meshes object as input and returns the average normal consistency across the batch. If the input meshes contain no meshes or all empty meshes, the function returns 0. The normal consistency is calculated based on the angles between the normals of neighboring faces in the meshes. The function handles cases where multiple faces share an edge and efficiently finds the vertices associated with each edge.",
