    "result": "To implement the `compose` method for the `Transform3d` class, we need to ensure that the method can handle multiple `Transform3d` objects, verify their types, and then combine their transformation matrices. The method should return a new `Transform3d` instance with the composed transformation matrix and update the internal list of transformations.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `compose` method:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: str = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self.device = device\n        self.dtype = dtype\n        if matrix is None:\n            # Initialize with an identity matrix if no matrix is provided\n            self._matrix = torch.eye(4, dtype=self.dtype, device=self.device)\n        else:\n            self._matrix = matrix.to(dtype=self.dtype, device=self.device)\n        self._transforms = [self._matrix]\n\n    def compose(self, *others: \"Transform3d\") -> \"Transform3d\":\n        # Verify that all provided arguments are instances of Transform3d\n        for other in others:\n            if not isinstance(other, Transform3d):\n                raise TypeError(\"All arguments must be instances of Transform3d\")\n\n        # Start with the current transformation matrix\n        composed_matrix = self._matrix.clone()\n\n        # Compose the transformation matrices\n        for other in others:\n            composed_matrix = composed_matrix @ other._matrix\n\n        # Create a new Transform3d instance with the composed matrix\n        new_transform = Transform3d(dtype=self.dtype, device=self.device, matrix=composed_matrix)\n\n        # Update the internal list of transformations\n        new_transform._transforms = self._transforms + [other._matrix for other in others]\n\n        return new_transform\n\n# Example usage:\n# t1 = Transform3d()\n# t2 = Transform3d()\n# t3 = t1.compose(t2)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method initializes the transformation matrix. If no matrix is provided, it defaults to a 4x4 identity matrix, which is typical for 3D transformations.\n\n2. **Type Checking**: The `compose` method first checks that all arguments are instances of `Transform3d`. If any argument is not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n\n3. **Matrix Composition**: The method starts with the current instance's transformation matrix (`self._matrix`). It then iteratively multiplies it with the matrices of the other `Transform3d` instances using matrix multiplication (`@` operator).\n\n4. **New Instance Creation**: A new `Transform3d` instance is created with the composed matrix. This ensures that the original instances remain unchanged, adhering to functional programming principles.\n\n5. **Updating Transforms List**: The `_transforms` list of the new instance is updated to include the matrices of all transformations involved in the composition.\n\nThis implementation provides a robust and flexible way to compose multiple 3D transformations in a chain.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `compose` for the `Transform3d` class that combines the current transform with any number of other `Transform3d` objects passed as arguments. The method should return a new `Transform3d` instance representing the composed transformation, which combines the internal transformation matrix of the current instance with those of the provided transforms. Ensure that the internal list of transformations (`self._transforms`) is updated accordingly. The method should also verify that all provided arguments are instances of `Transform3d`.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: Device = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self._matrix = ...\n        self._transforms = []\n        self.device = ...\n        self.dtype = ...\n\n    def compose(self, *others: \"Transform3d\") -> \"Transform3d\":\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
