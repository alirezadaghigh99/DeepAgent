    "result": "To complete the `triangular_kernel1d` function, we need to create a 1D triangular kernel with the specified `kernel_size`. The kernel should have a zero at the center and ones around it, with the length of the ones being approximately half of the `kernel_size`. Here's how you can implement this function using TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ndef triangular_kernel1d(kernel_size: int) -> tf.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a the 1D triangular kernel for LocalNormalizedCrossCorrelation.\n\n    Assume kernel_size is odd, it will be a smoothed from\n    a kernel which center part is zero.\n    Then length of the ones will be around half kernel_size.\n    The weight scale of the kernel does not matter as LNCC will normalize it.\n\n    :param kernel_size: scalar, size of the 1-D kernel\n    :return: kernel_weights, of shape (kernel_size, )\n    \"\"\"\n\n    assert kernel_size >= 3\n    assert kernel_size % 2 != 0\n\n    # Calculate the half size of the kernel\n    half_size = kernel_size // 2\n\n    # Create a triangular kernel\n    kernel = tf.range(half_size + 1, dtype=tf.float32)\n    kernel = tf.concat([kernel, tf.reverse(kernel[:-1], axis=[0])], axis=0)\n\n    # Normalize the kernel to have a zero at the center\n    kernel = kernel - tf.reduce_min(kernel)\n\n    return kernel\n\n# Example usage\nkernel_size = 5\nkernel = triangular_kernel1d(kernel_size)\nprint(kernel.numpy())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Kernel Size and Assertions**: The function starts by asserting that the `kernel_size` is at least 3 and is odd, which is necessary for creating a symmetric triangular kernel with a center.\n\n2. **Half Size Calculation**: The `half_size` is calculated as `kernel_size // 2`, which helps in determining the range of values for the triangular shape.\n\n3. **Triangular Kernel Creation**: \n   - A range of values from `0` to `half_size` is created using `tf.range`.\n   - This range is then mirrored to create a symmetric triangular shape using `tf.reverse` and `tf.concat`.\n\n4. **Normalization**: The kernel is adjusted to have a zero at the center by subtracting the minimum value from all elements.\n\n5. **Return**: The function returns the triangular kernel as a TensorFlow tensor.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the kernel is symmetric and has a zero at the center, with ones around it, as specified in the function's description.",
