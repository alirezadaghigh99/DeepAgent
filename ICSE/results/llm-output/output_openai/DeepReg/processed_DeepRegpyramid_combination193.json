    "result": "To create the `pyramid_combination` function, we need to perform linear interpolation in an n-dimensional space using the values at the corners of a hypercube. The function will use the provided weights to interpolate between these corner values. Here's how you can implement this function in Python:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef pyramid_combination(values, weight_floor, weight_ceil):\n    # Check if the length of values is a power of 2\n    n = len(weight_floor)\n    if len(values) != 2 ** n:\n        raise ValueError(\"The length of 'values' must be 2^n where n is the length of 'weight_floor' and 'weight_ceil'.\")\n\n    # Check if weight_floor and weight_ceil have the same length\n    if len(weight_floor) != len(weight_ceil):\n        raise ValueError(\"'weight_floor' and 'weight_ceil' must have the same length.\")\n\n    # Check if all tensors in values have the same shape\n    value_shape = values[0].shape\n    for v in values:\n        if v.shape != value_shape:\n            raise ValueError(\"All tensors in 'values' must have the same shape.\")\n\n    # Initialize the result tensor with zeros of the same shape as the values\n    result = torch.zeros_like(values[0])\n\n    # Iterate over all possible combinations of weights\n    for i in range(2 ** n):\n        # Calculate the weight for the current corner\n        weight = torch.ones_like(values[0])\n        for j in range(n):\n            if (i >> j) & 1:\n                weight *= weight_ceil[j]\n            else:\n                weight *= weight_floor[j]\n\n        # Add the weighted value to the result\n        result += weight * values[i]\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# values = [torch.tensor([1.0]), torch.tensor([2.0]), torch.tensor([3.0]), torch.tensor([4.0])]\n# weight_floor = [torch.tensor([0.5]), torch.tensor([0.5])]\n# weight_ceil = [torch.tensor([0.5]), torch.tensor([0.5])]\n# result = pyramid_combination(values, weight_floor, weight_ceil)\n# print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**:\n   - The function first checks if the length of `values` is `2^n`, where `n` is the length of `weight_floor` and `weight_ceil`. This ensures that the number of corner values matches the expected number for an n-dimensional hypercube.\n   - It also checks that `weight_floor` and `weight_ceil` have the same length, ensuring they are compatible for interpolation.\n   - Additionally, it verifies that all tensors in `values` have the same shape.\n\n2. **Interpolation**:\n   - The function initializes a result tensor with zeros, having the same shape as the tensors in `values`.\n   - It iterates over all possible combinations of weights (using binary representation to decide which weight to use for each dimension).\n   - For each combination, it calculates the product of the corresponding weights and uses it to scale the respective corner value.\n   - The weighted values are accumulated into the result tensor.\n\n3. **Output**:\n   - The function returns the interpolated tensor, which has the same shape as the elements in `values`.\n\nThis implementation uses PyTorch for tensor operations, but you can adapt it to use other libraries like NumPy if needed.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `pyramid_combination` that performs linear interpolation based on values at the corners of a hypercube in an n-dimensional space. The function accepts three main inputs: `values` (a list of tensors representing values at the corners), `weight_floor`, and `weight_ceil` (lists of tensors representing the interpolation weights). The function ensures that the shapes of the inputs are compatible, with `values` needing to have a length of `2^n` where `n` is the length of `weight_floor` and `weight_ceil`. It returns a tensor with the same shape as the elements in `values`.\n\nThe function includes error handling to check for mismatched dimensions between `values`, `weight_floor`, and `weight_ceil`, and also validates that the length of `values` matches the expected `2^n` based on the dimension of the weights. If these conditions are not met, the function raises a `ValueError`.",
