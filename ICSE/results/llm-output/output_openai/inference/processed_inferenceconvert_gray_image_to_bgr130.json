    "result": "To create a function that converts a grayscale image to a BGR image using OpenCV, you can follow these steps. The function will first check if the input image is indeed a grayscale image by examining its shape. If the image is grayscale, it will use OpenCV's `cv2.cvtColor` function to convert it to BGR format. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef convert_gray_image_to_bgr(gray_image):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert a grayscale image to BGR format.\n\n    Parameters:\n    gray_image (numpy.ndarray): Input grayscale image.\n\n    Returns:\n    numpy.ndarray: BGR image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the input image is a valid grayscale image\n    if len(gray_image.shape) == 2:\n        # Convert the grayscale image to BGR\n        bgr_image = cv2.cvtColor(gray_image, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR)\n        return bgr_image\n    elif len(gray_image.shape) == 3 and gray_image.shape[2] == 1:\n        # Handle the case where the grayscale image has a single channel dimension\n        gray_image = gray_image.squeeze(axis=2)\n        bgr_image = cv2.cvtColor(gray_image, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR)\n        return bgr_image\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input image is not a valid grayscale image.\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# gray_image = cv2.imread('path_to_grayscale_image', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)\n# bgr_image = convert_gray_image_to_bgr(gray_image)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the input image is a 2D array, which is typical for grayscale images. It also handles the case where the grayscale image might have an additional single channel dimension (e.g., shape `(height, width, 1)`).\n- **Conversion**: If the input is a valid grayscale image, it uses `cv2.cvtColor` with the `cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR` flag to convert the image to BGR format.\n- **Error Handling**: If the input image is not a valid grayscale image, the function raises a `ValueError`.\n\nThis function assumes that the input is a valid numpy array representing an image. Make sure to handle any file reading or preprocessing outside of this function.",
