    "result": "To implement the `detections_are_close_to_threshold` function, we first need to define the `Prediction` object structure. For this example, let's assume that the `Prediction` object has a list of detections, where each detection is a dictionary containing at least the class name and the confidence score. The function `count_detections_close_to_threshold` will iterate over these detections and count how many of them have confidence scores within the specified epsilon range of the threshold for the selected class names.\n\nHere's how you can implement these functions:\n\n```python\nclass Prediction:\n    def __init__(self, detections):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize a Prediction object.\n\n        :param detections: List of detections, where each detection is a dictionary\n                           with keys 'class_name' and 'confidence'.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.detections = detections\n\ndef count_detections_close_to_threshold(prediction, selected_class_names, threshold, epsilon):\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the number of detections close to the threshold.\n\n    :param prediction: Prediction object containing detections.\n    :param selected_class_names: Set of class names to consider.\n    :param threshold: The threshold value.\n    :param epsilon: The epsilon value for closeness to the threshold.\n    :return: Number of detections close to the threshold.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for detection in prediction.detections:\n        class_name = detection.get('class_name')\n        confidence = detection.get('confidence', 0)\n        if class_name in selected_class_names and abs(confidence - threshold) <= epsilon:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef detections_are_close_to_threshold(prediction, selected_class_names, threshold, epsilon, min_objects_close):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine if the number of detections close to the threshold is greater than or equal to the minimum specified.\n\n    :param prediction: Prediction object containing detections.\n    :param selected_class_names: Set of class names to consider.\n    :param threshold: The threshold value.\n    :param epsilon: The epsilon value for closeness to the threshold.\n    :param min_objects_close: Minimum number of objects close to the threshold.\n    :return: Boolean indicating if the condition is met.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = count_detections_close_to_threshold(prediction, selected_class_names, threshold, epsilon)\n    return count >= min_objects_close\n\n# Example usage:\n# detections = [\n#     {'class_name': 'cat', 'confidence': 0.75},\n#     {'class_name': 'dog', 'confidence': 0.80},\n#     {'class_name': 'cat', 'confidence': 0.78},\n#     {'class_name': 'bird', 'confidence': 0.60}\n# ]\n# prediction = Prediction(detections)\n# result = detections_are_close_to_threshold(prediction, {'cat', 'dog'}, 0.77, 0.03, 2)\n# print(result)  # Output: True\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- `Prediction` is a simple class that holds a list of detections.\n- `count_detections_close_to_threshold` iterates over the detections and counts those that are within the epsilon range of the threshold for the specified class names.\n- `detections_are_close_to_threshold` uses the count from `count_detections_close_to_threshold` to determine if it meets or exceeds the minimum number of objects close to the threshold.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called detections_are_close_to_threshold that takes in a Prediction object, a set of selected class names, a threshold value, an epsilon value, and a minimum number of objects close to the threshold. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the number of detections close to the threshold is greater than or equal to the minimum number specified. The function calls another function called count_detections_close_to_threshold to calculate the number of detections close to the threshold.",
