    "result": "To create the `load_image_rgb` function, we need to define a few key steps. First, we'll assume the existence of a `load_image` function that loads an image and returns it as a NumPy array. This function should also provide information about whether the image is in BGR format. If the image is in BGR format, we'll convert it to RGB. Additionally, we'll handle the `disable_preproc_auto_orient` flag, although its specific functionality isn't detailed in your request. For simplicity, we'll assume it doesn't affect the loading process in this implementation.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `load_image_rgb` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cv2\n\ndef load_image(value, disable_preproc_auto_orient):\n    \"\"\"\n    Mock function to load an image. This function should be replaced with the actual\n    image loading logic. It returns a tuple (image_array, is_bgr).\n    \n    For demonstration purposes, this function assumes the input is a file path and\n    uses OpenCV to load the image, which loads images in BGR format by default.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Load the image using OpenCV\n    image = cv2.imread(value)\n    \n    # Check if the image was loaded successfully\n    if image is None:\n        raise ValueError(\"Image could not be loaded. Please check the input value.\")\n    \n    # OpenCV loads images in BGR format\n    is_bgr = True\n    \n    return image, is_bgr\n\ndef load_image_rgb(value, disable_preproc_auto_orient=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Loads an image and returns it in RGB format.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    - value: The input value to load the image from (e.g., file path).\n    - disable_preproc_auto_orient: A boolean flag to disable automatic orientation processing.\n    \n    Returns:\n    - A NumPy array representing the image in RGB format.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Load the image using the load_image function\n    image, is_bgr = load_image(value, disable_preproc_auto_orient)\n    \n    # If the image is in BGR format, convert it to RGB\n    if is_bgr:\n        image_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)\n    else:\n        image_rgb = image\n    \n    return image_rgb\n\n# Example usage:\n# image_rgb = load_image_rgb('path_to_image.jpg')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **load_image Function**: This is a mock function that simulates loading an image. It uses OpenCV's `cv2.imread` to load the image, which by default loads images in BGR format. The function returns the image and a boolean indicating if it's in BGR format.\n\n2. **load_image_rgb Function**: This function calls `load_image` to get the image and its format. If the image is in BGR format, it uses OpenCV's `cv2.cvtColor` to convert it to RGB. The function then returns the RGB image.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: The `load_image` function checks if the image was loaded successfully and raises an error if not.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input to `load_image` is a file path. You may need to adjust the `load_image` function to handle other types of input, such as URLs or image data in memory, depending on your specific requirements.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called load_image_rgb that takes in a value of any type and a boolean disable_preproc_auto_orient as input. The function returns a NumPy array representing the loaded image in RGB format. The function internally calls another function load_image to load the image and determine if it is in BGR format. If the image is in BGR format, it converts it to RGB. The output of the function is the loaded image in RGB format.",
