    "result": "To create the `bytes_to_pillow_image` function, you'll need to use the `PIL` (Pillow) library to handle image operations and the `io` module to work with byte streams. Below is the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image, UnidentifiedImageError\nimport io\n\nclass EncodingError(Exception):\n    \"\"\"Custom exception for encoding errors.\"\"\"\n    pass\n\ndef bytes_to_pillow_image(payload: bytes) -> Image.Image:\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a bytes object to a Pillow Image object.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - payload: bytes - The bytes object containing image data.\n\n    Returns:\n    - Image.Image - A Pillow Image object.\n\n    Raises:\n    - EncodingError: If the bytes cannot be decoded into a valid image.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Use BytesIO to create a file-like object from the bytes\n        image_stream = io.BytesIO(payload)\n        # Attempt to open the image using Pillow\n        image = Image.open(image_stream)\n        # Ensure the image is loaded (this can raise an error if the image is not valid)\n        image.load()\n        return image\n    except (UnidentifiedImageError, OSError) as e:\n        # Raise a custom EncodingError if the image cannot be opened\n        raise EncodingError(\"Could not encode bytes to PIL image.\") from e\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Imports**:\n   - `Image` and `UnidentifiedImageError` are imported from the `PIL` (Pillow) library. `Image` is used to handle image operations, and `UnidentifiedImageError` is used to catch errors when an image cannot be identified.\n   - `io` is imported to use `BytesIO`, which allows you to treat bytes data as a file-like object.\n\n2. **Custom Exception**:\n   - `EncodingError` is defined as a custom exception to be raised when the bytes cannot be converted into a valid image.\n\n3. **Function Implementation**:\n   - The function `bytes_to_pillow_image` takes a `bytes` object called `payload` as input.\n   - It creates a `BytesIO` object from the `payload`, which allows the bytes to be treated as a file-like object.\n   - It attempts to open the image using `Image.open()`. If successful, it loads the image to ensure it's valid.\n   - If the image cannot be opened or is not recognized, an `UnidentifiedImageError` or `OSError` is caught, and an `EncodingError` is raised with a descriptive message.\n\nThis function will help you convert bytes data into a Pillow Image object, handling errors gracefully if the data is not a valid image.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called bytes_to_pillow_image that takes a bytes object called payload as input and returns a Pillow Image object. The function reads the bytes data using BytesIO, attempts to open it as an image using Image.open, and raises an EncodingError with the message \"Could not encode bytes to PIL image.\" if the image format is not recognized.",
