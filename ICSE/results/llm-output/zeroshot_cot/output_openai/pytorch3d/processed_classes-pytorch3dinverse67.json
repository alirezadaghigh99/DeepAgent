    "result": "To implement the `inverse` method for the `Transform3d` class, we need to consider two scenarios based on the `invert_composed` argument. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to implement this method:\n\n1. **Initialize the Method**: Define the `inverse` method with the `invert_composed` parameter.\n\n2. **Handle the `invert_composed` Case**:\n   - If `invert_composed` is `True`, we need to first compose all the transformations stored in the `_transforms` list into a single transformation matrix.\n   - Then, compute the inverse of this composed transformation matrix.\n   - Return a new `Transform3d` object initialized with this inverse matrix.\n\n3. **Handle the Non-`invert_composed` Case**:\n   - If `invert_composed` is `False`, we need to invert each transformation in the `_transforms` list independently.\n   - Create a new list of these inverted transformations.\n   - Return a new `Transform3d` object initialized with this list of inverted transformations.\n\n4. **Considerations**:\n   - Ensure that the method handles cases where there are no transformations stored.\n   - Use appropriate tensor operations to compute the inverse of matrices.\n\nHere's how the code can be structured:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Optional, List\n\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: str = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self._matrix = matrix if matrix is not None else torch.eye(4, dtype=dtype, device=device)\n        self._transforms: List[torch.Tensor] = []\n        self.device = device\n        self.dtype = dtype\n\n    def inverse(self, invert_composed: bool = False) -> \"Transform3d\":\n        if invert_composed:\n            # Compose all transformations into a single matrix\n            composed_matrix = self._matrix.clone()\n            for transform in self._transforms:\n                composed_matrix = composed_matrix @ transform\n            \n            # Invert the composed matrix\n            inverse_matrix = torch.linalg.inv(composed_matrix)\n            \n            # Return a new Transform3d object with the inverse matrix\n            return Transform3d(dtype=self.dtype, device=self.device, matrix=inverse_matrix)\n        else:\n            # Invert each transformation independently\n            inverted_transforms = [torch.linalg.inv(transform) for transform in reversed(self._transforms)]\n            \n            # Return a new Transform3d object with the list of inverted transformations\n            new_transform = Transform3d(dtype=self.dtype, device=self.device)\n            new_transform._transforms = inverted_transforms\n            return new_transform\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Matrix Composition**: When `invert_composed` is `True`, we multiply all matrices in `_transforms` to get a single transformation matrix, which we then invert.\n- **Independent Inversion**: When `invert_composed` is `False`, we invert each matrix in `_transforms` individually and store them in reverse order to maintain the correct transformation sequence.\n- **Matrix Inversion**: We use `torch.linalg.inv` to compute the inverse of a matrix.\n- **New Transform3d Object**: We create a new `Transform3d` object with the computed inverse matrix or list of matrices, ensuring the original object remains unchanged.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `inverse` for the `Transform3d` class that returns a new `Transform3d` object representing the inverse of the current transformation. The method should have an argument `invert_composed` which, when set to `True`, first composes the list of stored transformations and then inverts the result, and when set to `False`, inverts the individual stored transformations independently without composing them. The method should efficiently handle both cases, returning a new `Transform3d` object containing the inverse of the original transformation.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: Device = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self._matrix = ...\n        self._transforms = []\n        self.device = ...\n        self.dtype = ...\n\n    def inverse(self, invert_composed: bool = False) -> \"Transform3d\":\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
