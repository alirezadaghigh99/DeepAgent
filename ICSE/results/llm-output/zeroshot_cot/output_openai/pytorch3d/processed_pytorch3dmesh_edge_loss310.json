If it is, we return a tensor with a value of 0.0.\n\n- **Step 2**: We iterate over each mesh in the batch. For each mesh, we retrieve its edges and vertices.\n\n- **Step 3**: We calculate the edge lengths using the Euclidean distance between the vertices of each edge.\n\n- **Step 4**: We compute the loss for each edge as the squared difference between the edge length and the `target_length`. We then weight this loss by the inverse of the number of edges in the mesh.\n\n- **Step 5**: We sum the weighted losses for all meshes and divide by the total number of meshes to get the average loss.\n\nThis function should correctly compute the mesh edge length regularization loss as specified.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called mesh_edge_loss that computes the mesh edge length regularization loss averaged across all meshes in a batch. The function takes in two arguments: meshes (a Meshes object with a batch of meshes) and target_length (a float representing the resting value for the edge length). \n\nThe function calculates the average loss across the batch, where each mesh contributes equally to the final loss, regardless of the number of edges per mesh. Each mesh is weighted with the inverse number of edges, so that meshes with fewer edges have a higher impact on the final loss.\n\nIf the input meshes object is empty, the function returns a tensor with a value of 0.0. Otherwise, the function computes the loss by determining the weight for each edge based on the number of edges in the corresponding mesh. The loss is calculated as the squared difference between the edge length and the target length, multiplied by the weights. \n\nFinally, the function returns the sum of the weighted losses divided by the total number of meshes in the batch.",
