    "result": "To implement the `compose` method for the `Transform3d` class, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Verify Input Types**: Ensure that all arguments passed to the `compose` method are instances of `Transform3d`.\n\n2. **Combine Transformation Matrices**: Multiply the transformation matrices of the current instance and the provided `Transform3d` instances in the correct order to form a new transformation matrix.\n\n3. **Update the Internal List of Transformations**: Append the transformations from the provided instances to the internal list of transformations of the current instance.\n\n4. **Return a New `Transform3d` Instance**: Create and return a new `Transform3d` instance with the composed transformation matrix and updated list of transformations.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `compose` method:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: str = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self.device = device\n        self.dtype = dtype\n        if matrix is None:\n            self._matrix = torch.eye(4, dtype=dtype, device=device)  # Default to identity matrix\n        else:\n            self._matrix = matrix.to(dtype=dtype, device=device)\n        self._transforms = [self._matrix]\n\n    def compose(self, *others: \"Transform3d\") -> \"Transform3d\":\n        # Verify that all arguments are instances of Transform3d\n        for other in others:\n            if not isinstance(other, Transform3d):\n                raise TypeError(\"All arguments must be instances of Transform3d\")\n\n        # Start with the current transformation matrix\n        composed_matrix = self._matrix.clone()\n\n        # Combine the transformation matrices\n        for other in others:\n            composed_matrix = composed_matrix @ other._matrix\n\n        # Create a new Transform3d instance with the composed matrix\n        new_transform = Transform3d(dtype=self.dtype, device=self.device, matrix=composed_matrix)\n\n        # Update the internal list of transformations\n        new_transform._transforms = self._transforms + [other._matrix for other in others]\n\n        return new_transform\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Initialization**: The constructor initializes the transformation matrix to an identity matrix if no matrix is provided. It also sets up the device and dtype.\n\n- **Type Checking**: The `compose` method checks that all arguments are instances of `Transform3d`. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n\n- **Matrix Composition**: The method multiplies the current transformation matrix with each of the provided transformation matrices in sequence. This is done using the `@` operator, which is the matrix multiplication operator in PyTorch.\n\n- **New Instance Creation**: A new `Transform3d` instance is created with the composed matrix. The internal list of transformations is updated to include the matrices from the current instance and all provided instances.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the transformations are composed correctly and that the internal state of the transformations is maintained.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `compose` for the `Transform3d` class that combines the current transform with any number of other `Transform3d` objects passed as arguments. The method should return a new `Transform3d` instance representing the composed transformation, which combines the internal transformation matrix of the current instance with those of the provided transforms. Ensure that the internal list of transformations (`self._transforms`) is updated accordingly. The method should also verify that all provided arguments are instances of `Transform3d`.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: Device = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self._matrix = ...\n        self._transforms = []\n        self.device = ...\n        self.dtype = ...\n\n    def compose(self, *others: \"Transform3d\") -> \"Transform3d\":\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
