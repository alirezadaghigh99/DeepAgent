    "result": "To create the `mesh_normal_consistency` function, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input and Output**: The function takes a `Meshes` object as input and returns a single float value representing the average normal consistency across the batch.\n\n2. **Calculate Face Normals**: For each mesh, calculate the normal vector for each face. This is typically done using the cross product of two edges of the face.\n\n3. **Find Neighboring Faces**: Identify neighboring faces that share an edge. This involves finding edges and determining which faces share these edges.\n\n4. **Calculate Angles Between Normals**: For each pair of neighboring faces, calculate the angle between their normals. This can be done using the dot product.\n\n5. **Compute Normal Consistency**: Average the angles for each mesh and then across the batch.\n\n6. **Handle Edge Cases**: If there are no meshes or all meshes are empty, return 0.\n\nLet's implement this step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Face Normals\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the normal for each face in the mesh. This can be done using the cross product of two edges of the face.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom pytorch3d.structures import Meshes\n\ndef calculate_face_normals(verts, faces):\n    # Get the vertices of each face\n    v0 = verts[faces[:, 0]]\n    v1 = verts[faces[:, 1]]\n    v2 = verts[faces[:, 2]]\n    \n    # Calculate the edges\n    edge1 = v1 - v0\n    edge2 = v2 - v0\n    \n    # Calculate the normal using cross product\n    normals = torch.cross(edge1, edge2, dim=1)\n    \n    # Normalize the normals\n    normals = torch.nn.functional.normalize(normals, p=2, dim=1)\n    \n    return normals\n```\n\n### Step 2: Find Neighboring Faces\n\nNext, we need to find neighboring faces that share an edge. This involves creating a mapping from edges to faces.\n\n```python\ndef find_neighboring_faces(faces):\n    # Create a dictionary to map edges to faces\n    edge_to_faces = {}\n    \n    for i, face in enumerate(faces):\n        # Get the edges of the face\n        edges = [(face[0], face[1]), (face[1], face[2]), (face[2], face[0])]\n        \n        for edge in edges:\n            # Sort the edge to ensure consistent ordering\n            edge = tuple(sorted(edge))\n            \n            if edge not in edge_to_faces:\n                edge_to_faces[edge] = []\n            edge_to_faces[edge].append(i)\n    \n    return edge_to_faces\n```\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Angles Between Normals\n\nFor each pair of neighboring faces, calculate the angle between their normals.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_normal_consistency(normals, edge_to_faces):\n    total_angle = 0.0\n    count = 0\n    \n    for faces in edge_to_faces.values():\n        if len(faces) < 2:\n            continue\n        \n        # Compare each pair of faces sharing the edge\n        for i in range(len(faces)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(faces)):\n                normal1 = normals[faces[i]]\n                normal2 = normals[faces[j]]\n                \n                # Calculate the angle between the normals\n                cos_angle = torch.dot(normal1, normal2)\n                angle = torch.acos(cos_angle.clamp(-1.0, 1.0))\n                \n                total_angle += angle\n                count += 1\n    \n    if count == 0:\n        return 0.0\n    \n    return total_angle / count\n```\n\n### Step 4: Compute Average Normal Consistency\n\nFinally, compute the average normal consistency across the batch of meshes.\n\n```python\ndef mesh_normal_consistency(meshes: Meshes):\n    if len(meshes) == 0:\n        return 0.0\n    \n    total_consistency = 0.0\n    valid_mesh_count = 0\n    \n    for i in range(len(meshes)):\n        verts = meshes.verts_list()[i]\n        faces = meshes.faces_list()[i]\n        \n        if len(faces) == 0:\n            continue\n        \n        normals = calculate_face_normals(verts, faces)\n        edge_to_faces = find_neighboring_faces(faces)\n        consistency = calculate_normal_consistency(normals, edge_to_faces)\n        \n        total_consistency += consistency\n        valid_mesh_count += 1\n    \n    if valid_mesh_count == 0:\n        return 0.0\n    \n    return total_consistency / valid_mesh_count\n```\n\nThis function should now compute the average normal consistency for a batch of meshes, handling cases where there are no meshes or all meshes are empty.",
    "prompt": "Define a Python function called mesh_normal_consistency that computes the normal consistency of each mesh in a batch of meshes. The function takes a Meshes object as input and returns the average normal consistency across the batch. If the input meshes contain no meshes or all empty meshes, the function returns 0. The normal consistency is calculated based on the angles between the normals of neighboring faces in the meshes. The function handles cases where multiple faces share an edge and efficiently finds the vertices associated with each edge.",
