    "result": "To create the `look_at_view_transform1` function, we need to compute the rotation and translation matrices that transform world coordinates to view coordinates based on the camera's position and orientation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to implement this function:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: We'll use PyTorch for tensor operations, which allows us to perform computations on both CPU and GPU.\n\n2. **Convert Angles**: If the angles are provided in degrees, convert them to radians for trigonometric calculations.\n\n3. **Compute Camera Position**: If the `eye` parameter is not provided, compute the camera position using spherical coordinates derived from `dist`, `elev`, and `azim`.\n\n4. **Compute Forward, Right, and Up Vectors**: These vectors define the camera's orientation in space. The forward vector points from the camera to the object, the right vector is perpendicular to the forward and up vectors, and the up vector is typically the world's up direction.\n\n5. **Construct Rotation Matrix**: Use the right, up, and forward vectors to construct the rotation matrix.\n\n6. **Compute Translation Matrix**: The translation matrix is derived from the camera's position.\n\n7. **Return the Rotation and Translation Matrices**: These matrices will transform points from world coordinates to view coordinates.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef look_at_view_transform1(dist=1.0, elev=0.0, azim=0.0, degrees=True, eye=None, at=(0, 0, 0), up=(0, 1, 0), device=\"cpu\"):\n    # Convert inputs to tensors\n    dist = torch.tensor(dist, device=device)\n    elev = torch.tensor(elev, device=device)\n    azim = torch.tensor(azim, device=device)\n    at = torch.tensor(at, device=device, dtype=torch.float32)\n    up = torch.tensor(up, device=device, dtype=torch.float32)\n\n    # Convert degrees to radians if necessary\n    if degrees:\n        elev = torch.deg2rad(elev)\n        azim = torch.deg2rad(azim)\n\n    # Calculate the camera position if eye is not provided\n    if eye is None:\n        eye = torch.zeros(3, device=device)\n        eye[0] = dist * torch.cos(elev) * torch.sin(azim)\n        eye[1] = dist * torch.sin(elev)\n        eye[2] = dist * torch.cos(elev) * torch.cos(azim)\n    else:\n        eye = torch.tensor(eye, device=device, dtype=torch.float32)\n\n    # Calculate the forward vector\n    forward = at - eye\n    forward = forward / torch.norm(forward)\n\n    # Calculate the right vector\n    right = torch.cross(up, forward)\n    right = right / torch.norm(right)\n\n    # Recalculate the up vector\n    up = torch.cross(forward, right)\n    up = up / torch.norm(up)\n\n    # Construct the rotation matrix\n    R = torch.stack((right, up, forward), dim=0)\n\n    # Construct the translation matrix\n    T = -torch.matmul(R, eye)\n\n    return R, T\n\n# Example usage\nR, T = look_at_view_transform1(dist=2.0, elev=30.0, azim=45.0, degrees=True)\nprint(\"Rotation Matrix:\\n\", R)\nprint(\"Translation Matrix:\\n\", T)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Rotation Matrix (R)**: This matrix is constructed using the right, up, and forward vectors, which define the camera's orientation.\n- **Translation Matrix (T)**: This matrix is computed by transforming the camera's position into the view space using the rotation matrix.\n\nThis function allows for flexible camera positioning and orientation, and it can be executed on either CPU or GPU depending on the specified device.",
