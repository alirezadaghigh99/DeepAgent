    "result": "To create the `look_at_rotation` function, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Normalize the Input Vectors**: Ensure that the input vectors are normalized. This is important for calculating the correct axes.\n\n2. **Calculate the Axes**: Compute the `z`, `x`, and `y` axes for the camera's coordinate system. The `z` axis is the direction from the camera position to the \"at\" point. The `x` axis is perpendicular to both the `up` vector and the `z` axis. The `y` axis is perpendicular to both the `z` and `x` axes.\n\n3. **Handle Edge Cases**: Specifically, handle cases where the `x` axis might be close to zero, which can occur if the `up` vector is parallel to the `z` axis.\n\n4. **Form the Rotation Matrix**: Concatenate the `x`, `y`, and `z` axes to form the rotation matrix.\n\n5. **Transpose the Matrix**: Return the transposed rotation matrix to transform from world coordinates to view coordinates.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `look_at_rotation` function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef normalize(v):\n    \"\"\"Normalize a vector or batch of vectors.\"\"\"\n    if isinstance(v, torch.Tensor):\n        return v / torch.norm(v, dim=-1, keepdim=True)\n    else:\n        v = np.array(v)\n        return v / np.linalg.norm(v, axis=-1, keepdims=True)\n\ndef look_at_rotation(camera_position, at, up, device='cpu'):\n    # Convert inputs to tensors if they are not already\n    if not isinstance(camera_position, torch.Tensor):\n        camera_position = torch.tensor(camera_position, dtype=torch.float32, device=device)\n    if not isinstance(at, torch.Tensor):\n        at = torch.tensor(at, dtype=torch.float32, device=device)\n    if not isinstance(up, torch.Tensor):\n        up = torch.tensor(up, dtype=torch.float32, device=device)\n\n    # Ensure the inputs are batched\n    if camera_position.dim() == 1:\n        camera_position = camera_position.unsqueeze(0)\n    if at.dim() == 1:\n        at = at.unsqueeze(0)\n    if up.dim() == 1:\n        up = up.unsqueeze(0)\n\n    # Calculate the z axis\n    z_axis = normalize(at - camera_position)\n\n    # Calculate the x axis\n    x_axis = normalize(torch.cross(up, z_axis, dim=-1))\n\n    # Handle the case where x_axis is close to zero\n    if torch.any(torch.norm(x_axis, dim=-1) < 1e-6):\n        x_axis = normalize(torch.cross(z_axis, torch.tensor([0.0, 1.0, 0.0], device=device), dim=-1))\n\n    # Calculate the y axis\n    y_axis = torch.cross(z_axis, x_axis, dim=-1)\n\n    # Form the rotation matrix\n    R = torch.stack((x_axis, y_axis, z_axis), dim=-1)\n\n    # Return the transposed rotation matrix\n    return R.transpose(-2, -1)\n\n# Example usage:\ncamera_position = (0, 0, 0)\nat = (0, 0, -1)\nup = (0, 1, 0)\ndevice = 'cpu'\n\nR = look_at_rotation(camera_position, at, up, device)\nprint(R)\n```\n\nThis function handles both single and batched inputs, normalizes the vectors, and constructs the rotation matrix correctly. It also includes a check to handle cases where the `x` axis might be close to zero by using an alternative method to compute it.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called look_at_rotation that takes in the camera_position, at, up vectors, and device type as inputs. The function returns a batched rotation matrix R representing the transformation from world coordinates to view coordinates. The camera_position, at, and up vectors can be 3-element tuples/lists or torch tensors of shape (1, 3) or (N, 3), where N is the batch size. The function normalizes the input vectors, calculates the x, y, and z axes, and handles cases where the x-axis is close to zero. Finally, it concatenates the axes to form the rotation matrix R and returns the transposed matrix.",
