    "result": "To create a Python function `chamfer_distance` that calculates the Chamfer distance between two point clouds, we need to break down the task into several steps. We'll start by defining the function signature and then implement the core logic step by step. Here's how we can approach it:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function Signature\n\nFirst, we need to define the function signature with the required parameters and optional parameters. We'll use `numpy` for numerical operations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef chamfer_distance(x, y, x_lengths=None, y_lengths=None, x_normals=None, y_normals=None, \n                     weights=None, batch_reduction='mean', point_reduction='mean', \n                     norm=2, single_directional=False, abs_cosine=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Chamfer distance between two point clouds x and y.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - x: np.ndarray, shape (B, N, D) where B is batch size, N is number of points, D is dimension.\n    - y: np.ndarray, shape (B, M, D) where B is batch size, M is number of points, D is dimension.\n    - x_lengths: Optional[np.ndarray], shape (B,), lengths of each point cloud in x.\n    - y_lengths: Optional[np.ndarray], shape (B,), lengths of each point cloud in y.\n    - x_normals: Optional[np.ndarray], shape (B, N, D), normals for each point in x.\n    - y_normals: Optional[np.ndarray], shape (B, M, D), normals for each point in y.\n    - weights: Optional[np.ndarray], shape (B, N), weights for each point in x.\n    - batch_reduction: str, reduction method over batch ('mean', 'sum', 'none').\n    - point_reduction: str, reduction method over points ('mean', 'sum', 'none').\n    - norm: int, norm degree for distance calculation (1 for L1, 2 for L2).\n    - single_directional: bool, if True, calculate only one directional distance.\n    - abs_cosine: bool, if True, use absolute cosine distance for normals.\n\n    Returns:\n    - Tuple of reduced distance and reduced cosine distance of normals.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Implementation will go here\n```\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Pairwise Distances\n\nNext, we need to calculate the pairwise distances between points in `x` and `y`. We'll use the specified norm (L1 or L2).\n\n```python\ndef pairwise_distances(x, y, norm=2):\n    if norm == 1:\n        return np.sum(np.abs(x[:, :, np.newaxis, :] - y[:, np.newaxis, :, :]), axis=-1)\n    elif norm == 2:\n        return np.sqrt(np.sum((x[:, :, np.newaxis, :] - y[:, np.newaxis, :, :]) ** 2, axis=-1))\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported norm type. Use 1 for L1 or 2 for L2.\")\n\n# Inside chamfer_distance function\ndist_x_to_y = pairwise_distances(x, y, norm)\ndist_y_to_x = pairwise_distances(y, x, norm)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Chamfer Distance\n\nFor each point in `x`, find the nearest point in `y` and vice versa. Then, reduce these distances according to the specified reduction method.\n\n```python\ndef reduce_distances(distances, reduction='mean'):\n    if reduction == 'mean':\n        return np.mean(distances, axis=-1)\n    elif reduction == 'sum':\n        return np.sum(distances, axis=-1)\n    elif reduction == 'none':\n        return distances\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported reduction type. Use 'mean', 'sum', or 'none'.\")\n\n# Inside chamfer_distance function\nmin_dist_x_to_y = np.min(dist_x_to_y, axis=-1)\nmin_dist_y_to_x = np.min(dist_y_to_x, axis=-1)\n\nif not single_directional:\n    chamfer_dist = reduce_distances(min_dist_x_to_y, point_reduction) + reduce_distances(min_dist_y_to_x, point_reduction)\nelse:\n    chamfer_dist = reduce_distances(min_dist_x_to_y, point_reduction)\n\nchamfer_dist = reduce_distances(chamfer_dist, batch_reduction)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Cosine Distance of Normals\n\nIf normals are provided, calculate the cosine distance between them.\n\n```python\ndef cosine_distance(x_normals, y_normals, abs_cosine=False):\n    dot_product = np.sum(x_normals[:, :, np.newaxis, :] * y_normals[:, np.newaxis, :, :], axis=-1)\n    x_norm = np.linalg.norm(x_normals, axis=-1, keepdims=True)\n    y_norm = np.linalg.norm(y_normals, axis=-1, keepdims=True)\n    cosine_sim = dot_product / (x_norm * y_norm)\n    if abs_cosine:\n        cosine_sim = np.abs(cosine_sim)\n    return 1 - cosine_sim\n\n# Inside chamfer_distance function\nif x_normals is not None and y_normals is not None:\n    cos_dist_x_to_y = cosine_distance(x_normals, y_normals, abs_cosine)\n    min_cos_dist_x_to_y = np.min(cos_dist_x_to_y, axis=-1)\n    if not single_directional:\n        cos_dist_y_to_x = cosine_distance(y_normals, x_normals, abs_cosine)\n        min_cos_dist_y_to_x = np.min(cos_dist_y_to_x, axis=-1)\n        cosine_dist = reduce_distances(min_cos_dist_x_to_y, point_reduction) + reduce_distances(min_cos_dist_y_to_x, point_reduction)\n    else:\n        cosine_dist = reduce_distances(min_cos_dist_x_to_y, point_reduction)\n    cosine_dist = reduce_distances(cosine_dist, batch_reduction)\nelse:\n    cosine_dist = None\n```\n\n### Step 5: Return the Results\n\nFinally, return the calculated Chamfer distance and cosine distance.\n\n```python\n    return chamfer_dist, cosine_dist\n```\n\n### Complete Function\n\nHere's the complete function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef chamfer_distance(x, y, x_lengths=None, y_lengths=None, x_normals=None, y_normals=None, \n                     weights=None, batch_reduction='mean', point_reduction='mean', \n                     norm=2, single_directional=False, abs_cosine=False):\n    def pairwise_distances(x, y, norm=2):\n        if norm == 1:\n            return np.sum(np.abs(x[:, :, np.newaxis, :] - y[:, np.newaxis, :, :]), axis=-1)\n        elif norm == 2:\n            return np.sqrt(np.sum((x[:, :, np.newaxis, :] - y[:, np.newaxis, :, :]) ** 2, axis=-1))\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Unsupported norm type.
