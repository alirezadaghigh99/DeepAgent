    "result": "To define the function `_get_splat_kernel_normalization`, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: Start by defining the function with the appropriate parameters: `offsets` and `sigma` with a default value of 0.5.\n\n2. **Input Validation**: Check if `sigma` is less than or equal to 0.0 and raise a `ValueError` if it is.\n\n3. **Normalization Constant Calculation**:\n   - Compute the squared values of the `offsets` tensor.\n   - Sum these squared values.\n   - Use the exponential function to calculate the normalization constant. This involves using the formula `exp(-sum(offsets^2) / (2 * sigma^2))`.\n\n4. **Add Epsilon**: Add an epsilon value of 0.05 to the normalization constant to ensure gradient flow.\n\n5. **Return Normalized Value**: Calculate the normalized value by dividing `(1 + epsilon)` by the normalization constant and return it.\n\nHere's the complete code for the function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _get_splat_kernel_normalization(offsets, sigma=0.5):\n    if sigma <= 0.0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Sigma must be greater than 0.0\")\n    \n    # Calculate the squared values of the offsets\n    squared_offsets = offsets ** 2\n    \n    # Sum the squared values\n    sum_squared_offsets = torch.sum(squared_offsets)\n    \n    # Calculate the normalization constant using the exponential function\n    normalization_constant = torch.exp(-sum_squared_offsets / (2 * sigma ** 2))\n    \n    # Add epsilon to the normalization constant\n    epsilon = 0.05\n    normalization_constant += epsilon\n    \n    # Calculate and return the normalized value\n    normalized_value = (1 + epsilon) / normalization_constant\n    return normalized_value\n```\n\nThis function uses PyTorch for tensor operations, which is common in deep learning applications. The function ensures that the normalization constant is always positive and non-zero, which is crucial for maintaining gradient flow during backpropagation.",
    "prompt": "Define a Python function called `_get_splat_kernel_normalization` that takes in a tensor `offsets` and a float `sigma` with a default value of 0.5. If the `sigma` value is less than or equal to 0.0, a ValueError is raised. The function calculates a normalization constant using the formula involving exponential and sum operations on the squared values of the `offsets` tensor. An epsilon value of 0.05 is added to the normalization constant to ensure gradient flow through non-boundary pixels. The function returns a normalized value by dividing (1 + epsilon) by the normalization constant.",
