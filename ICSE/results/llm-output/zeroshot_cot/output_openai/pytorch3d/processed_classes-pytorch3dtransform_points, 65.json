    "result": "To implement the `transform_points` method for the `Transform3d` class, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Input Dimensions**: Determine if the input points are in 2D or 3D format.\n2. **Add Homogeneous Coordinate**: Add a fourth coordinate to the points to enable homogeneous transformation.\n3. **Apply Transformation**: Use the transformation matrix to transform the points.\n4. **Handle Homogeneous Coordinate**: Divide by the homogeneous coordinate to convert back to 3D points, and optionally clamp it to avoid division by zero.\n5. **Return Transformed Points**: Return the transformed points in the same format as the input.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: str = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self._matrix = matrix if matrix is not None else torch.eye(4, dtype=dtype, device=device)\n        self.device = device\n        self.dtype = dtype\n\n    def transform_points(self, points: torch.Tensor, eps: Optional[float] = None) -> torch.Tensor:\n        # Check the dimensions of the input points\n        if points.dim() == 2 and points.size(1) == 3:\n            # Points are in (P, 3) format\n            points = points.unsqueeze(0)  # Add a batch dimension to make it (1, P, 3)\n            single_batch = True\n        elif points.dim() == 3 and points.size(2) == 3:\n            # Points are in (N, P, 3) format\n            single_batch = False\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Points should be of shape (P, 3) or (N, P, 3)\")\n\n        # Add a homogeneous coordinate\n        ones = torch.ones((points.size(0), points.size(1), 1), dtype=points.dtype, device=points.device)\n        points_homogeneous = torch.cat([points, ones], dim=-1)  # Shape (N, P, 4)\n\n        # Apply the transformation matrix\n        transformed_points_homogeneous = torch.bmm(points_homogeneous, self._matrix.transpose(0, 1))\n\n        # Divide by the homogeneous coordinate\n        w = transformed_points_homogeneous[..., 3:4]\n        if eps is not None:\n            w = torch.clamp(w, min=eps)\n        transformed_points = transformed_points_homogeneous[..., :3] / w\n\n        # If the input was (P, 3), return (P, 3) instead of (1, P, 3)\n        if single_batch:\n            transformed_points = transformed_points.squeeze(0)\n\n        return transformed_points\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Input Handling**: The method first checks if the input points are in 2D or 3D format. If they are in 2D, it adds a batch dimension to make processing uniform.\n- **Homogeneous Coordinates**: A column of ones is appended to the points to convert them to homogeneous coordinates.\n- **Transformation**: The transformation matrix is applied using batched matrix multiplication (`torch.bmm`).\n- **Normalization**: The resulting points are divided by the homogeneous coordinate. If `eps` is provided, it clamps the homogeneous coordinate to avoid division by zero.\n- **Output Format**: The method ensures that the output format matches the input format, removing the batch dimension if it was added initially.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `transform_points` for the `Transform3d` class that transforms a set of 3D points using the transformation matrix. The method should handle points in either 2D (P, 3) or 3D (N, P, 3) format, where P is the number of points and N is the batch size. It should perform a homogeneous transformation, adding a fourth coordinate to the points, applying the transformation matrix using batched matrix multiplication, and then dividing by the homogeneous coordinate. If an optional `eps` argument is provided, it should clamp the homogeneous coordinate to avoid division by zero.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: Device = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self._matrix = ...\n        self._transforms = []\n        self.device = ...\n        self.dtype = ...\n\n    def transform_points(self, points, eps: Optional[float] = None) -> torch.Tensor:\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
