    "result": "To implement the `masked_gather` function, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Validate Input Dimensions**: Ensure that the batch dimensions of `points` and `idx` match. If they don't, raise a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Replace `-1` Indices**: Replace all `-1` indices in `idx` with `0` to handle padding.\n\n3. **Gather Points**: Use the modified `idx` to gather points from the `points` tensor.\n\n4. **Mask Gathered Points**: Set the gathered points corresponding to the original `-1` indices to `0.0`.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: Return the modified gathered points tensor.\n\nLet's implement this step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Validate Input Dimensions\n\nFirst, we need to ensure that the batch dimensions of `points` and `idx` match. We can do this by comparing the first dimension of both tensors.\n\n### Step 2: Replace `-1` Indices\n\nWe will replace `-1` indices in `idx` with `0` to handle padding. This can be done using a simple tensor operation.\n\n### Step 3: Gather Points\n\nUsing the modified `idx`, we will gather points from the `points` tensor. This involves using the `torch.gather` function.\n\n### Step 4: Mask Gathered Points\n\nAfter gathering, we need to set the gathered values corresponding to the original `-1` indices to `0.0`.\n\n### Step 5: Return the Result\n\nFinally, we return the modified gathered points tensor.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef masked_gather(points, idx):\n    # Step 1: Validate Input Dimensions\n    if points.size(0) != idx.size(0):\n        raise ValueError(\"Batch dimensions of points and idx must match.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Replace `-1` Indices\n    idx_replaced = idx.clone()\n    idx_replaced[idx_replaced == -1] = 0\n    \n    # Step 3: Gather Points\n    # Assuming idx is of shape (batch_size, ...) and points is of shape (batch_size, num_points, feature_dim)\n    # We need to expand idx to match the dimensions required for gather\n    expanded_idx = idx_replaced.unsqueeze(-1).expand(-1, -1, points.size(-1))\n    gathered_points = torch.gather(points, 1, expanded_idx)\n    \n    # Step 4: Mask Gathered Points\n    mask = (idx == -1).unsqueeze(-1).expand_as(gathered_points)\n    gathered_points[mask] = 0.0\n    \n    # Step 5: Return the Result\n    return gathered_points\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Input Validation**: We check if the batch dimensions (first dimension) of `points` and `idx` match. If not, a `ValueError` is raised.\n\n- **Index Replacement**: We create a copy of `idx` and replace all `-1` values with `0`.\n\n- **Gathering**: We use `torch.gather` to collect points based on the modified indices. The `expand` function is used to ensure the indices have the correct shape for gathering.\n\n- **Masking**: We create a mask for the original `-1` indices and set the corresponding gathered points to `0.0`.\n\nThis function should work for tensors with different shapes of `idx`, as long as the batch dimensions match.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function `masked_gather` that collects points from a tensor `points` based on indices provided in `idx`, where some indices might be `-1` to indicate padding. The function should replace `-1` indices with `0`, gather the corresponding points, and then set the gathered values corresponding to the original `-1` indices to `0.0`. Ensure that `points` and `idx` have matching batch dimensions, and raise a `ValueError` if they do not. The function should handle different shapes of `idx` and return the gathered points tensor.",
