    "result": "To generate the `_compute_occlusion_layers` function, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input and Output**: \n   - The input `q_depth` is a tensor representing depth values.\n   - The output `occlusion_layers` is a tensor with shape `(N, H, W, 9)`, where each of the 9 values corresponds to one of the nine splatting directions.\n\n2. **Define the Splatting Directions**:\n   - The nine splatting directions can be thought of as a 3x3 grid around each pixel, including the pixel itself.\n\n3. **Compute Occlusion Layers**:\n   - For each pixel, compare its depth with the depths of its neighbors in the 3x3 grid.\n   - Determine if the neighboring pixel is in the background, on the same surface, or in the foreground.\n\n4. **Implement the Function**:\n   - Use tensor operations to efficiently compute the occlusion layers for each pixel.\n\nLet's start implementing the function step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function and Initialize Variables\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _compute_occlusion_layers(q_depth):\n    # Ensure q_depth is a 4D tensor (N, H, W, 1)\n    if q_depth.dim() != 4 or q_depth.size(-1) != 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"q_depth must be a 4D tensor with shape (N, H, W, 1)\")\n\n    N, H, W, _ = q_depth.shape\n    occlusion_layers = torch.zeros((N, H, W, 9), dtype=torch.int32, device=q_depth.device)\n    \n    return occlusion_layers\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the Splatting Directions\n\nThe splatting directions can be represented as offsets in the 2D grid:\n\n```python\n# Define the 3x3 grid offsets for splatting directions\noffsets = [\n    (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1),\n    (0, -1),  (0, 0),  (0, 1),\n    (1, -1),  (1, 0),  (1, 1)\n]\n```\n\n### Step 3: Compute Occlusion Layers\n\nFor each direction, compute the occlusion status:\n\n```python\ndef _compute_occlusion_layers(q_depth):\n    if q_depth.dim() != 4 or q_depth.size(-1) != 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"q_depth must be a 4D tensor with shape (N, H, W, 1)\")\n\n    N, H, W, _ = q_depth.shape\n    occlusion_layers = torch.zeros((N, H, W, 9), dtype=torch.int32, device=q_depth.device)\n\n    # Define the 3x3 grid offsets for splatting directions\n    offsets = [\n        (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1),\n        (0, -1),  (0, 0),  (0, 1),\n        (1, -1),  (1, 0),  (1, 1)\n    ]\n\n    # Iterate over each offset\n    for idx, (dy, dx) in enumerate(offsets):\n        # Shift the q_depth tensor according to the current offset\n        shifted_depth = torch.roll(q_depth, shifts=(dy, dx), dims=(1, 2))\n\n        # Compare the shifted depth with the original depth\n        occlusion_layers[..., idx] = torch.where(\n            shifted_depth < q_depth, -1,  # Background\n            torch.where(shifted_depth > q_depth, 1, 0)  # Foreground or Same surface\n        )\n\n    return occlusion_layers\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Offsets**: We define a list of offsets representing the 3x3 grid around each pixel.\n- **Shifting**: We use `torch.roll` to shift the `q_depth` tensor according to each offset.\n- **Comparison**: We compare the shifted depth with the original depth to determine if the neighboring pixel is in the background, on the same surface, or in the foreground.\n- **Occlusion Values**: \n  - `-1` indicates the pixel is in the background.\n  - `0` indicates the pixel is on the same surface.\n  - `1` indicates the pixel is in the foreground.\n\nThis function should efficiently compute the occlusion layers for each pixel in the input tensor.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called `_compute_occlusion_layers` that takes a tensor `q_depth` as input. The function calculates occlusion layers for each splatting pixel, determining whether it splats from a background, surface, or foreground depth relative to the splatted pixel. The output is a tensor `occlusion_layers` with shape (N, H, W, 9), where each of the 9 values corresponds to one of the nine splatting directions. The values in the tensor indicate whether the splat is on the same surface level as the pixel, in the background (occluded by another splat above it), or in the foreground.",
