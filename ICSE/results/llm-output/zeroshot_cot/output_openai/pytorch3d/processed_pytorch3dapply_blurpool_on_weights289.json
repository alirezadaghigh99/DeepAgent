    "result": "To create the `apply_blurpool_on_weights` function, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Padding the Weights**: We will pad the weights tensor to handle edge cases during pooling.\n2. **Max Pooling**: Apply a 2-tap max filter to the padded weights.\n3. **Blur Filter**: Apply a 2-tap blur filter using linear interpolation.\n4. **Return the Result**: Ensure the output tensor has the same shape as the input.\n\nLet's implement this step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Padding the Weights\n\nWe'll start by padding the weights tensor. For simplicity, we'll use zero padding on both sides of the last dimension.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef pad_weights(weights):\n    # Pad the weights tensor on the last dimension\n    # We use padding of 1 on both sides for the last dimension\n    padding = (1, 1)\n    padded_weights = F.pad(weights, padding, mode='constant', value=0)\n    return padded_weights\n```\n\n### Step 2: Max Pooling\n\nNext, we'll apply a 2-tap max filter on the padded weights.\n\n```python\ndef max_pooling(padded_weights):\n    # Apply a 2-tap max pooling on the last dimension\n    # We use a kernel size of 2 and stride of 1\n    max_pooled_weights = F.max_pool1d(padded_weights.unsqueeze(1), kernel_size=2, stride=1)\n    return max_pooled_weights.squeeze(1)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Blur Filter\n\nNow, we'll apply a 2-tap blur filter using linear interpolation.\n\n```python\ndef blur_filter(max_pooled_weights):\n    # Apply a 2-tap blur filter using linear interpolation\n    # We use a kernel size of 2 and stride of 1\n    blurred_weights = F.avg_pool1d(max_pooled_weights.unsqueeze(1), kernel_size=2, stride=1)\n    return blurred_weights.squeeze(1)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Combine Everything\n\nFinally, we'll combine all the steps into the `apply_blurpool_on_weights` function.\n\n```python\ndef apply_blurpool_on_weights(weights):\n    # Step 1: Pad the weights\n    padded_weights = pad_weights(weights)\n    \n    # Step 2: Apply max pooling\n    max_pooled_weights = max_pooling(padded_weights)\n    \n    # Step 3: Apply blur filter\n    blurred_weights = blur_filter(max_pooled_weights)\n    \n    # Return the blurred weights with the same shape as input\n    return blurred_weights\n\n# Example usage\nweights = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]])\nblurred_weights = apply_blurpool_on_weights(weights)\nprint(blurred_weights)\n```\n\nThis function will take a tensor of weights, apply the specified operations, and return a tensor of the same shape with the blurred weights. Note that the example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a simple tensor.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called apply_blurpool_on_weights that filters weights with a 2-tap max filter followed by a 2-tap blur filter, producing a wide and smooth upper envelope on the weights. The input is a tensor called weights of shape `(..., dim)` and the output is a tensor called blured_weights of the same shape `(..., dim)`. The function pads the weights, applies max pooling, and then performs linear interpolation to create the blurred weights.",
