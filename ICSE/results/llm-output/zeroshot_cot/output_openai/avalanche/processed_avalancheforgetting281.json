    "result": "To create the `forgetting` function, we will break down the task into several steps. We'll start by defining the function and handling the input parameters. Then, we'll calculate the forgetting values based on the provided accuracy matrix and boundary indices. Finally, we'll return the forgetting matrix.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function and Handle Inputs\n\nFirst, we'll define the function `forgetting` with the necessary parameters: `accuracy_matrix` and `boundary_indices`. We'll also handle the case where `boundary_indices` is not provided.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef forgetting(accuracy_matrix, boundary_indices=None):\n    # Determine the number of experiences\n    num_experiences = accuracy_matrix.shape[1]\n    \n    # If boundary_indices is not provided, create a default list\n    if boundary_indices is None:\n        boundary_indices = list(range(num_experiences))\n    \n    # Initialize the forgetting matrix with zeros\n    forgetting_matrix = np.zeros_like(accuracy_matrix)\n    \n    return forgetting_matrix\n```\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Forgetting Values\n\nNext, we'll iterate over each experience and calculate the forgetting values. For each experience, we'll find the time it was learned and compute the forgetting by subtracting the accuracy at the learning time from the current accuracy.\n\n```python\ndef forgetting(accuracy_matrix, boundary_indices=None):\n    num_experiences = accuracy_matrix.shape[1]\n    \n    if boundary_indices is None:\n        boundary_indices = list(range(num_experiences))\n    \n    forgetting_matrix = np.zeros_like(accuracy_matrix)\n    \n    # Iterate over each experience\n    for exp_idx in range(num_experiences):\n        # Determine the time the experience was learned\n        learn_time = boundary_indices[exp_idx]\n        \n        # Calculate forgetting for each time step\n        for time_idx in range(learn_time, accuracy_matrix.shape[0]):\n            forgetting_matrix[time_idx, exp_idx] = (\n                accuracy_matrix[learn_time, exp_idx] - accuracy_matrix[time_idx, exp_idx]\n            )\n    \n    return forgetting_matrix\n```\n\n### Step 3: Ensure Forgetting is Zero Before Learning\n\nWe need to ensure that forgetting is set to zero before the experience is learned. This can be done by iterating only from the learning time onward, as shown in the previous step.\n\n### Final Code\n\nHere's the complete function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef forgetting(accuracy_matrix, boundary_indices=None):\n    num_experiences = accuracy_matrix.shape[1]\n    \n    if boundary_indices is None:\n        boundary_indices = list(range(num_experiences))\n    \n    forgetting_matrix = np.zeros_like(accuracy_matrix)\n    \n    for exp_idx in range(num_experiences):\n        learn_time = boundary_indices[exp_idx]\n        \n        for time_idx in range(learn_time, accuracy_matrix.shape[0]):\n            forgetting_matrix[time_idx, exp_idx] = (\n                accuracy_matrix[learn_time, exp_idx] - accuracy_matrix[time_idx, exp_idx]\n            )\n    \n    return forgetting_matrix\n```\n\nThis function calculates the forgetting matrix by iterating over each experience and computing the difference between the accuracy at the learning time and the current accuracy. Forgetting is set to zero before the experience is learned.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called forgetting that calculates forgetting based on an accuracy matrix and boundary indices. The function takes in a 2D accuracy matrix with shape <time, experiences> and an optional list of boundary indices. If boundary_indices is not provided, it is assumed to be a list ranging from 0 to the number of experiences in the accuracy matrix. \n\nThe forgetting calculation is done by subtracting the accuracy at the time the experience was learned from the current accuracy for each experience. Forgetting is set to zero before learning on the experience. The function returns a forgetting matrix with the same shape as the input accuracy matrix.",
