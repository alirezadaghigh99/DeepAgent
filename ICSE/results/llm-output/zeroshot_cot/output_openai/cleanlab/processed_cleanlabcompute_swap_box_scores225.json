    "result": "To create the `compute_swap_box_scores` function, we need to consider several aspects, including handling the input parameters, calculating the swap scores, and managing cases where the number of annotated and predicted boxes differ. Let's break down the implementation step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function Signature\n\nFirst, we define the function signature with the required parameters and their types.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_swap_box_scores(labels, predictions, alpha=0.5, high_probability_threshold=0.8, overlapping_label_check=True, auxiliary_inputs=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate swap scores for annotated bounding boxes in each image.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    - labels: List[Dict], each dictionary contains labels for an image.\n    - predictions: List[np.ndarray], each array contains model predictions for an image.\n    - alpha: float, weighting parameter for score calculation.\n    - high_probability_threshold: float, threshold for high probability predictions.\n    - overlapping_label_check: bool, flag to check overlapping labels.\n    - auxiliary_inputs: List[Dict], additional inputs for each image.\n    \n    Returns:\n    - List[np.ndarray]: Swap scores for annotated boxes in each image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the list to store swap scores for each image\n    swap_scores = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each image's labels and predictions\n    for image_index, (image_labels, image_predictions) in enumerate(zip(labels, predictions)):\n        # Placeholder for swap scores for the current image\n        image_swap_scores = []\n        \n        # Process each annotated box in the image\n        for label in image_labels:\n            # Placeholder for the score of the current box\n            score = 1.0  # Start with a high score, indicating low likelihood of swap\n            \n            # Calculate the score based on predictions and other parameters\n            # (To be implemented in the next steps)\n            \n            # Append the score to the list for the current image\n            image_swap_scores.append(score)\n        \n        # Convert the list of scores to a numpy array and append to the results\n        swap_scores.append(np.array(image_swap_scores))\n    \n    return swap_scores\n```\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Swap Scores\n\nNext, we need to implement the logic to calculate the swap scores for each annotated box. This involves comparing the predicted class probabilities with the annotated labels and considering the optional parameters.\n\n```python\ndef compute_swap_box_scores(labels, predictions, alpha=0.5, high_probability_threshold=0.8, overlapping_label_check=True, auxiliary_inputs=None):\n    swap_scores = []\n    \n    for image_index, (image_labels, image_predictions) in enumerate(zip(labels, predictions)):\n        image_swap_scores = []\n        \n        for label in image_labels:\n            # Extract the true class and bounding box from the label\n            true_class = label['class']\n            true_box = label['bbox']\n            \n            # Find the predicted box with the highest overlap and matching class\n            max_overlap = 0\n            best_prediction = None\n            \n            for prediction in image_predictions:\n                predicted_class = np.argmax(prediction['scores'])\n                predicted_box = prediction['bbox']\n                predicted_score = prediction['scores'][predicted_class]\n                \n                # Calculate overlap (IoU) between true_box and predicted_box\n                iou = calculate_iou(true_box, predicted_box)\n                \n                # Check if this prediction is a better match\n                if predicted_class == true_class and iou > max_overlap:\n                    max_overlap = iou\n                    best_prediction = prediction\n            \n            # Calculate the swap score based on the best prediction\n            if best_prediction:\n                predicted_score = best_prediction['scores'][true_class]\n                if predicted_score > high_probability_threshold:\n                    score = 1 - alpha * (1 - predicted_score)\n                else:\n                    score = alpha * predicted_score\n            else:\n                score = 0  # No matching prediction found\n            \n            image_swap_scores.append(score)\n        \n        swap_scores.append(np.array(image_swap_scores))\n    \n    return swap_scores\n\ndef calculate_iou(box1, box2):\n    # Calculate the Intersection over Union (IoU) of two bounding boxes\n    x1, y1, x2, y2 = box1\n    x1_p, y1_p, x2_p, y2_p = box2\n    \n    # Calculate intersection\n    inter_x1 = max(x1, x1_p)\n    inter_y1 = max(y1, y1_p)\n    inter_x2 = min(x2, x2_p)\n    inter_y2 = min(y2, y2_p)\n    \n    inter_area = max(0, inter_x2 - inter_x1) * max(0, inter_y2 - inter_y1)\n    \n    # Calculate union\n    box1_area = (x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1)\n    box2_area = (x2_p - x1_p) * (y2_p - y1_p)\n    \n    union_area = box1_area + box2_area - inter_area\n    \n    # Calculate IoU\n    iou = inter_area / union_area if union_area > 0 else 0\n    \n    return iou\n```\n\n### Step 3: Handle Optional Parameters\n\nFinally, we can incorporate the optional parameters like `overlapping_label_check` and `auxiliary_inputs` to refine the score calculation further. This step is more context-specific and would depend on the exact requirements and data structure of these parameters.\n\nThis implementation provides a basic framework for calculating swap scores. You can further refine it by incorporating additional logic based on the optional parameters and specific requirements of your use case.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called compute_swap_box_scores that calculates a numeric score for each annotated bounding box in each image, estimating the likelihood that the class label for this box was not accidentally swapped with another class. The function takes in several optional parameters including labels (a list of dictionaries containing labels for each image), predictions (a list of numpy arrays corresponding to model predictions for each image), alpha (a weighting parameter), high_probability_threshold (a probability threshold), overlapping_label_check (a boolean flag), and auxiliary_inputs (a list of dictionaries containing additional inputs for each image).\n\nThe function returns a list of numpy arrays where each element corresponds to the swap scores for annotated boxes in each image. The scores range between 0 and 1, with lower values indicating boxes that are more likely to have been mislabeled. The function also handles cases where the number of annotated and predicted boxes vary for each image.",
