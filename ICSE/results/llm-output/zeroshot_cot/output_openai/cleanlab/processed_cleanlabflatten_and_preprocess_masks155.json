    "result": "To create the `flatten_and_preprocess_masks` function, we need to handle two main tasks: flattening the `labels` array and reshaping the `pred_probs` array so that its channels align with the flattened `labels`. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Flatten the `labels` array**: \n   - If `labels` is a 2D array, we can simply flatten it using `numpy.flatten()`.\n   - If `labels` is a 3D array, we need to flatten it across the spatial dimensions (height and width) while keeping the depth (or channel) dimension intact.\n\n2. **Reshape the `pred_probs` array**:\n   - `pred_probs` is a 4D array with dimensions (batch_size, height, width, num_classes).\n   - We need to reshape it so that it aligns with the flattened `labels`. This involves transposing and then flattening the spatial dimensions while keeping the class dimension intact.\n\nLet's implement this step by step:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef flatten_and_preprocess_masks(labels, pred_probs):\n    # Step 1: Flatten the labels array\n    if labels.ndim == 2:\n        # If labels is 2D, simply flatten it\n        flattened_labels = labels.flatten()\n    elif labels.ndim == 3:\n        # If labels is 3D, flatten the spatial dimensions\n        flattened_labels = labels.reshape(-1, labels.shape[-1])\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Labels array must be 2D or 3D.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Reshape the pred_probs array\n    if pred_probs.ndim != 4:\n        raise ValueError(\"pred_probs array must be 4D.\")\n    \n    # Transpose pred_probs to bring the class dimension to the front\n    transposed_pred_probs = np.transpose(pred_probs, (0, 3, 1, 2))\n    \n    # Flatten the spatial dimensions (height and width)\n    flattened_pred_probs = transposed_pred_probs.reshape(transposed_pred_probs.shape[0], transposed_pred_probs.shape[1], -1)\n    \n    # Reshape to align with flattened labels\n    flattened_pred_probs = flattened_pred_probs.reshape(-1, transposed_pred_probs.shape[1])\n\n    return flattened_labels, flattened_pred_probs\n\n# Example usage:\n# labels = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]])  # Example 2D labels\n# pred_probs = np.random.rand(1, 2, 2, 3)  # Example 4D pred_probs with 3 classes\n# flattened_labels, flattened_pred_probs = flatten_and_preprocess_masks(labels, pred_probs)\n```\n\nThis function will take care of flattening the `labels` and reshaping the `pred_probs` to ensure that the channels align correctly with the flattened labels. Make sure to adjust the input arrays according to your specific use case.",
