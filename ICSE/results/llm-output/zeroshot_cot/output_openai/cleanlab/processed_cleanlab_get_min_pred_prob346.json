    "result": "To generate the function `_get_min_pred_prob`, we will break down the task into several steps. Let's start by outlining the steps and then implement them in code.\n\n### Steps to Implement `_get_min_pred_prob`\n\n1. **Initialize the `pred_probs` list**: Start with a list containing a single element `1.0` to handle cases where the input list might be empty.\n\n2. **Iterate through the `predictions` list**: For each NumPy array in the list, perform the following:\n   - Extract the last column of the array, which represents the class prediction probabilities.\n   - Append these probabilities to the `pred_probs` list.\n\n3. **Calculate the minimum probability**: Use `np.min` to find the minimum value in the `pred_probs` list.\n\n4. **Return the minimum probability**: Return the calculated minimum probability as a float.\n\nNow, let's implement the function in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef _get_min_pred_prob(predictions):\n    # Step 1: Initialize pred_probs with a value of 1.0\n    pred_probs = [1.0]\n    \n    # Step 2: Iterate through each prediction in the input list\n    for prediction in predictions:\n        # Extract the last column of each class prediction\n        last_column = prediction[:, -1]\n        # Append the extracted probabilities to pred_probs\n        pred_probs.extend(last_column)\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the minimum value in pred_probs\n    min_prob = np.min(pred_probs)\n    \n    # Step 4: Return the minimum probability\n    return float(min_prob)\n\n# Example usage:\n# predictions = [np.array([[0.1, 0.9], [0.3, 0.7]]), np.array([[0.4, 0.6], [0.2, 0.8]])]\n# print(_get_min_pred_prob(predictions))  # Output should be 0.6\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Initialization**: The `pred_probs` list is initialized with `1.0` to ensure that `np.min` has a value to operate on, even if the input list is empty.\n- **Iteration and Extraction**: For each prediction array, the last column is extracted using `prediction[:, -1]`, which is then extended into the `pred_probs` list.\n- **Minimum Calculation**: `np.min(pred_probs)` computes the minimum value from the list of probabilities.\n- **Return**: The function returns the minimum probability as a float.\n\nThis function will correctly compute the minimum prediction probability from a list of NumPy arrays, each representing class prediction probabilities.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called _get_min_pred_prob that takes in a list of NumPy arrays called predictions. The function returns a float value which is the minimum prediction probability out of all the predictions in the input list. The function first initializes a list called pred_probs with a value of 1.0 to avoid calling np.min on an empty array. It then iterates through each prediction in the input list, extracts the last column of each class prediction, and appends it to the pred_probs list. Finally, the function calculates the minimum value in the pred_probs list using np.min and returns it as the output.",
