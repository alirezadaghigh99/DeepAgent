    "result": "To create the `issues_from_scores` function, we need to handle both image-level and pixel-level scores, apply the threshold to identify issues, and return the appropriate results based on the presence of pixel scores. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: We need to ensure that the inputs are valid. This includes checking if `image_scores` is provided, if `threshold` is within the valid range, and if `threshold` is not `None`.\n\n2. **Threshold Application**:\n   - If `pixel_scores` is provided, we apply the threshold to the pixel scores to create a boolean mask indicating which pixels are considered issues.\n   - If `pixel_scores` is not provided, we apply the threshold to the image scores to identify which images are considered issues.\n\n3. **Return the Result**:\n   - If `pixel_scores` is provided, return the boolean mask.\n   - If `pixel_scores` is not provided, return the indices of images that are below the threshold.\n\nLet's implement the function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import Optional, Union\n\ndef issues_from_scores(image_scores: np.ndarray, \n                       pixel_scores: Optional[np.ndarray] = None, \n                       threshold: float = None) -> Union[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:\n    # Input validation\n    if image_scores is None:\n        raise ValueError(\"image_scores must be provided.\")\n    if threshold is None or not (0 <= threshold <= 1):\n        raise ValueError(\"threshold must be a float between 0 and 1.\")\n    \n    # If pixel_scores is provided, create a boolean mask for pixel-level issues\n    if pixel_scores is not None:\n        if pixel_scores.shape[0] != image_scores.shape[0]:\n            raise ValueError(\"The first dimension of pixel_scores must match the length of image_scores.\")\n        # Create a boolean mask where pixel scores are below the threshold\n        pixel_issues_mask = pixel_scores < threshold\n        return pixel_issues_mask\n    \n    # If pixel_scores is not provided, return indices of images with scores below the threshold\n    else:\n        image_issues_indices = np.where(image_scores < threshold)[0]\n        return image_issues_indices\n\n# Example usage:\n# image_scores = np.array([0.9, 0.7, 0.4, 0.6])\n# pixel_scores = np.random.rand(4, 5, 5)  # Example pixel scores\n# threshold = 0.5\n# result = issues_from_scores(image_scores, pixel_scores, threshold)\n# print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Validation**: We check if `image_scores` is `None` and if `threshold` is within the valid range.\n- **Pixel Scores Handling**: If `pixel_scores` is provided, we ensure its first dimension matches the length of `image_scores` and then create a boolean mask for pixels below the threshold.\n- **Image Scores Handling**: If `pixel_scores` is not provided, we find indices of images with scores below the threshold using `np.where`.\n- **Return**: Depending on the presence of `pixel_scores`, we return either a boolean mask or an array of indices.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `issues_from_scores` that identifies mislabeled pixels or images based on label quality scores and a user-defined `threshold`. The function should accept:\n\n- `image_scores` (np.ndarray): Array of shape `(N,)` for image scores.\n- `pixel_scores` (Optional[np.ndarray]): Optional array of shape `(N, H, W)` for pixel-level scores.\n- `threshold` (float): A value between 0 and 1 that determines which scores are considered issues.\n\nThe function returns:\n\n- A boolean mask (np.ndarray) if `pixel_scores` is provided, marking issues as `True`.\n- An array of image indices (np.ndarray) if `pixel_scores` is not provided, for images below the threshold.\n\nRaise `ValueError` if `image_scores` is `None`, if `threshold` is outside the [0, 1] range, or if `threshold` is `None`.",
