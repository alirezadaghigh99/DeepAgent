    "result": "To create the `get_label_quality_ensemble_scores` function, we need to break down the task into several steps. We'll start by defining the function signature and then implement each part of the functionality. Here's how we can approach it:\n\n1. **Function Signature**: Define the function with the specified parameters.\n2. **Adjust Predicted Probabilities**: Implement logic to adjust predicted probabilities if required.\n3. **Compute Label Quality Scores**: Implement different methods to compute label quality scores.\n4. **Aggregate Scores**: Implement the logic to aggregate scores using the specified weighting scheme.\n5. **Return the Final Scores**: Ensure the function returns the computed scores.\n\nLet's start by defining the function signature and setting up the basic structure:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_label_quality_ensemble_scores(labels, pred_probs_list, method='default', adjust_pred_probs=False,\n                                      weight_ensemble_members_by='uniform', custom_weights=None,\n                                      log_loss_search_T_values=None, verbose=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate label quality scores based on predictions from an ensemble of models.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - labels: numpy array containing the labels for the dataset.\n    - pred_probs_list: list of numpy arrays, where each array represents the predicted probabilities from one model.\n    - method: string indicating the label quality scoring method to use.\n    - adjust_pred_probs: boolean indicating whether to adjust the predicted probabilities.\n    - weight_ensemble_members_by: string indicating the weighting scheme to aggregate scores from each model.\n    - custom_weights: numpy array of custom weights if using the \"custom\" weighting scheme.\n    - log_loss_search_T_values: list of float values for log loss search.\n    - verbose: boolean indicating whether to print statements.\n\n    Returns:\n    - numpy array containing one score per example.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Adjust predicted probabilities if required\n    if adjust_pred_probs:\n        pred_probs_list = [adjust_probabilities(probs) for probs in pred_probs_list]\n    \n    # Step 2: Compute label quality scores for each model\n    scores_list = []\n    for pred_probs in pred_probs_list:\n        scores = compute_label_quality_scores(labels, pred_probs, method, log_loss_search_T_values)\n        scores_list.append(scores)\n    \n    # Step 3: Aggregate scores using the specified weighting scheme\n    final_scores = aggregate_scores(scores_list, weight_ensemble_members_by, custom_weights)\n    \n    if verbose:\n        print(\"Final label quality scores computed.\")\n    \n    return final_scores\n\ndef adjust_probabilities(pred_probs):\n    # Implement logic to adjust predicted probabilities\n    # Placeholder: return the probabilities as is\n    return pred_probs\n\ndef compute_label_quality_scores(labels, pred_probs, method, log_loss_search_T_values):\n    # Implement different methods to compute label quality scores\n    # Placeholder: return random scores for demonstration\n    return np.random.rand(len(labels))\n\ndef aggregate_scores(scores_list, weight_ensemble_members_by, custom_weights):\n    # Implement logic to aggregate scores using the specified weighting scheme\n    # Placeholder: return the mean of scores for demonstration\n    return np.mean(scores_list, axis=0)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Adjust Predicted Probabilities**: This is a placeholder function where you can implement any logic needed to adjust the predicted probabilities.\n- **Compute Label Quality Scores**: This function should implement the logic for different scoring methods. Currently, it returns random scores for demonstration.\n- **Aggregate Scores**: This function aggregates scores from different models. Currently, it uses a simple mean for demonstration.\n\nNext, we can expand on each of these placeholder functions to implement the actual logic based on your requirements. If you have specific methods or adjustments in mind, please let me know, and I can help implement those.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called get_label_quality_ensemble_scores that calculates label quality scores based on predictions from an ensemble of models. The function takes in the following parameters:\n\n- labels: a numpy array containing the labels for the dataset.\n- pred_probs_list: a list of numpy arrays, where each array represents the predicted probabilities from one model in the ensemble.\n- method: a string indicating the label quality scoring method to use.\n- adjust_pred_probs: a boolean indicating whether to adjust the predicted probabilities.\n- weight_ensemble_members_by: a string indicating the weighting scheme to aggregate scores from each model.\n- custom_weights: a numpy array of custom weights if using the \"custom\" weighting scheme.\n- log_loss_search_T_values: a list of float values for log loss search.\n- verbose: a boolean indicating whether to print statements.\n\nThe function computes label quality scores for each model's predicted probabilities and aggregates them based on the chosen weighting scheme. The output is a numpy array containing one score (between 0 and 1) per example, where lower scores indicate more likely mislabeled examples.",
