    "result": "To create the `js_div_loss_2d` function, we need to calculate the Jensen-Shannon divergence between two heatmaps. The Jensen-Shannon divergence is a method of measuring the similarity between two probability distributions. It is a symmetric and smoothed version of the Kullback-Leibler divergence.\n\nHere's how we can implement this step by step:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: We'll use PyTorch for tensor operations.\n\n2. **Define the Function**: The function will take `pred`, `target`, and `reduction` as arguments.\n\n3. **Ensure Valid Probability Distributions**: The input tensors should represent valid probability distributions. This means they should be non-negative and sum to 1 along the appropriate dimensions.\n\n4. **Calculate the Jensen-Shannon Divergence**:\n   - Compute the average distribution `M = 0.5 * (pred + target)`.\n   - Calculate the Kullback-Leibler divergence for both `pred` and `target` with respect to `M`.\n   - The Jensen-Shannon divergence is the average of these two Kullback-Leibler divergences.\n\n5. **Apply Reduction**: Depending on the `reduction` parameter, return the loss as is, or compute the mean or sum.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef js_div_loss_2d(pred, target, reduction='mean'):\n    # Ensure the input tensors are valid probability distributions\n    pred = F.softmax(pred, dim=-1)\n    target = F.softmax(target, dim=-1)\n    \n    # Calculate the average distribution\n    M = 0.5 * (pred + target)\n    \n    # Calculate the Kullback-Leibler divergence\n    kl_div_pred = F.kl_div(pred.log(), M, reduction='none')\n    kl_div_target = F.kl_div(target.log(), M, reduction='none')\n    \n    # Calculate the Jensen-Shannon divergence\n    js_div = 0.5 * (kl_div_pred + kl_div_target)\n    \n    # Apply the specified reduction\n    if reduction == 'mean':\n        return js_div.mean()\n    elif reduction == 'sum':\n        return js_div.sum()\n    elif reduction == 'none':\n        return js_div\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Invalid reduction type: {reduction}\")\n\n# Example usage\npred = torch.full((1, 1, 2, 4), 0.125)\nloss = js_div_loss_2d(pred, pred)\nprint(loss.item())  # Should return 0.0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Softmax**: We use `softmax` to ensure that `pred` and `target` are valid probability distributions.\n- **Kullback-Leibler Divergence**: Calculated using `F.kl_div`, which computes the KL divergence between two distributions.\n- **Reduction**: The function supports three types of reduction: `'none'`, `'mean'`, and `'sum'`.\n\nThis function should correctly compute the Jensen-Shannon divergence loss between two 2D heatmaps.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called js_div_loss_2d that calculates the Jensen-Shannon divergence loss between two heatmaps. The function takes three arguments: pred (input tensor with shape (B, N, H, W)), target (target tensor with shape (B, N, H, W)), and reduction (specifies the reduction to apply to the output: 'none', 'mean', or 'sum'). The function returns a tensor.\n\nExample usage:\npred = torch.full((1, 1, 2, 4), 0.125)\nloss = js_div_loss_2d(pred, pred)\nloss.item() should return 0.0.",
