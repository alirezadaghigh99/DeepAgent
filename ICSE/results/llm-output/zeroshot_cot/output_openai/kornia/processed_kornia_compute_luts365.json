    "result": "To create the `_compute_luts` function, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input and Output Shapes**: \n   - `tiles_x_im` is a 6D tensor with shape `(B, GH, GW, C, TH, TW)`, where:\n     - `B` is the batch size.\n     - `GH` and `GW` are the grid height and width, respectively.\n     - `C` is the number of channels.\n     - `TH` and `TW` are the tile height and width.\n   - The function should return a 5D tensor with shape `(B, GH, GW, C, 256)`.\n\n2. **Histogram Calculation**:\n   - For each tile, compute the histogram of pixel values for each channel.\n   - If `diff` is `True`, use a differentiable method to compute the histogram.\n\n3. **Clip the Histogram**:\n   - If `clip` is greater than 0, apply contrast limiting by clipping the histogram values.\n\n4. **Compute the LUT**:\n   - Normalize the histogram to create a cumulative distribution function (CDF).\n   - Use the CDF to create a lookup table (LUT) for each tile.\n\n5. **Return the LUTs**.\n\nLet's start coding the function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef _compute_luts(tiles_x_im, num_bins=256, clip=0, diff=False):\n    B, GH, GW, C, TH, TW = tiles_x_im.shape\n    luts = np.zeros((B, GH, GW, C, num_bins), dtype=np.float32)\n    \n    for b in range(B):\n        for gh in range(GH):\n            for gw in range(GW):\n                for c in range(C):\n                    tile = tiles_x_im[b, gh, gw, c]\n                    \n                    # Compute histogram\n                    if diff:\n                        # Use a differentiable histogram method if required\n                        hist, _ = np.histogram(tile, bins=num_bins, range=(0, num_bins), density=False)\n                    else:\n                        hist, _ = np.histogram(tile, bins=num_bins, range=(0, num_bins), density=False)\n                    \n                    # Clip histogram if clip > 0\n                    if clip > 0:\n                        excess = np.maximum(hist - clip, 0)\n                        hist = np.minimum(hist, clip)\n                        hist += excess.sum() // num_bins\n                    \n                    # Compute CDF\n                    cdf = hist.cumsum()\n                    cdf = (cdf - cdf.min()) * (num_bins - 1) / (cdf.max() - cdf.min())\n                    cdf = cdf.astype(np.float32)\n                    \n                    # Store LUT\n                    luts[b, gh, gw, c] = cdf\n    \n    return luts\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Histogram Calculation**: We use `np.histogram` to compute the histogram of each tile. If `diff` is `True`, you might want to replace this with a differentiable histogram method, but for simplicity, we use the same method here.\n- **Clipping**: If `clip` is greater than 0, we limit the histogram values to `clip` and redistribute the excess uniformly.\n- **CDF and LUT**: We compute the cumulative distribution function (CDF) from the histogram and normalize it to create the LUT.\n\nThis function should work for the given requirements. If you need a differentiable histogram, you might need to use a library like PyTorch or TensorFlow to implement that part.",
