If not, we use `torch.cdist` directly.\n  \n- **Squared Norms**: We calculate the squared norms of `d1` and `d2` using `torch.sum` along the appropriate dimension.\n\n- **Pairwise Squared Distances**: We compute the pairwise squared distances using matrix multiplication (`torch.mm`) and broadcasting. The formula used is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{dist\\_squared} = \\text{d1\\_squared} - 2 \\times (\\text{d1} \\cdot \\text{d2}^T) + \\text{d2\\_squared}^T\n  \\]\n\n- **Clamping and Square Root**: We clamp the squared distances to ensure they are non-negative and then take the square root to get the Euclidean distances.\n\nThis function should work efficiently for both MPS-compatible and non-compatible tensors.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `_cdist` that:\n\n- Takes two parameters:\n  - `d1`: A tensor.\n  - `d2`: Another tensor.\n- The function calculates the pairwise Euclidean distance between `d1` and `d2` similar to `torch.cdist`.\n- If both tensors are not safe for Metal Performance Shaders (MPS), the function will use `torch.cdist` directly.\n- Otherwise, the function manually computes the Euclidean distances using matrix operations:\n  - Computes the squared distance for each tensor.\n  - Repeats the squared distances and performs matrix multiplication.\n  - Clamps the result to a minimum of 0.0 and takes the square root to get the final distances.\n- Returns the computed distance matrix.",
