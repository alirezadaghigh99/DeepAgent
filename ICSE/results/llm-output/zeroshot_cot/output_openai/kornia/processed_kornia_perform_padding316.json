    "result": "To create the `_perform_padding` function, we need to ensure that the height (H) and width (W) of the image are both divisible by 16. If they are not, we will pad the image with zeros (or any other padding value) to make them divisible by 16. Here's how we can implement this step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate the padding required**: Determine how much padding is needed for both the height and width to make them divisible by 16.\n\n2. **Apply the padding**: Use a padding function to apply the calculated padding to the image.\n\n3. **Return the padded image and the padding values**: Return the padded image along with the amount of padding applied to the height and width.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\n\ndef _perform_padding(image: Tensor) -> tuple[Tensor, int, int]:\n    # Get the current height and width of the image\n    _, _, H, W = image.shape\n    \n    # Calculate the padding needed for height and width to be divisible by 16\n    h_pad = (16 - H % 16) % 16\n    w_pad = (16 - W % 16) % 16\n    \n    # Calculate padding for each side\n    pad_top = h_pad // 2\n    pad_bottom = h_pad - pad_top\n    pad_left = w_pad // 2\n    pad_right = w_pad - pad_left\n    \n    # Apply padding\n    image_padded = torch.nn.functional.pad(image, (pad_left, pad_right, pad_top, pad_bottom))\n    \n    return image_padded, h_pad, w_pad\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Calculate Padding**: We calculate `h_pad` and `w_pad` to determine how much padding is needed to make the height and width divisible by 16. The modulo operation helps in determining the remainder when divided by 16, and we use `(16 - remainder) % 16` to get the padding needed.\n\n- **Apply Padding**: We use `torch.nn.functional.pad` to apply the calculated padding. The padding is applied symmetrically (half on each side), but if the padding is odd, the extra pixel is added to the bottom or right.\n\n- **Return Values**: The function returns the padded image and the total padding applied to the height and width.",
