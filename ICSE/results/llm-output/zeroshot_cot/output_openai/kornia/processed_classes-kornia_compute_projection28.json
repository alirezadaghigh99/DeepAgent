    "result": "To implement the `_compute_projection` method for the `DepthWarper` class, we need to ensure that the method uses the precomputed projection matrix to transform the input coordinates from the source camera frame to the destination camera frame. The method should also check if the projection matrix and source pinhole camera are initialized, raising a `ValueError` if they are not.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `_compute_projection` method:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\n\nclass DepthWarper:\n    # Assuming the rest of the class is defined as provided\n\n    def _compute_projection(self, x: float, y: float, invd: float) -> Tensor:\n        # Check if the projection matrix and source pinhole camera are initialized\n        if self._dst_proj_src is None or self._pinhole_src is None:\n            raise ValueError(\"Projection matrix or source pinhole camera is not initialized.\")\n\n        # Create a homogeneous coordinate for the source point\n        # The point in homogeneous coordinates is [x, y, 1, invd]\n        point_src = torch.tensor([x, y, 1.0, invd], dtype=torch.float32)\n\n        # Perform the projection using the precomputed projection matrix\n        projected_point = self._dst_proj_src @ point_src\n\n        # Normalize the projected coordinates\n        # The projected_point is in the form [x', y', z']\n        # We need to divide by z' to get the normalized coordinates\n        z = projected_point[2] + self.eps  # Add epsilon to avoid division by zero\n        x_proj = projected_point[0] / z\n        y_proj = projected_point[1] / z\n\n        # Return the projected coordinates as a tensor\n        return torch.tensor([x_proj, y_proj], dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0)\n\n# Note: This implementation assumes that the projection matrix is a 3x4 matrix\n# and that the input point is in homogeneous coordinates with an inverse depth.\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization Check**: The method first checks if the projection matrix (`_dst_proj_src`) and the source pinhole camera (`_pinhole_src`) are initialized. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Homogeneous Coordinates**: The input point `(x, y)` is converted into homogeneous coordinates by appending `1` and the inverse depth `invd`. This results in a 4-element vector `[x, y, 1, invd]`.\n\n3. **Projection**: The method uses the precomputed projection matrix to transform the source point into the destination frame. This is done using matrix multiplication.\n\n4. **Normalization**: The resulting projected point is in homogeneous coordinates `[x', y', z']`. To get the actual 2D coordinates, we divide `x'` and `y'` by `z'`, ensuring to add a small epsilon to `z'` to prevent division by zero.\n\n5. **Output**: The method returns the projected coordinates as a tensor of shape `[1, 2]`.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the projection matrix is a 3x4 matrix, which is typical for such transformations in computer vision tasks. Adjustments may be needed based on the specific details of the `DepthWarper` class and its dependencies.",
    "prompt": "Implement the `_compute_projection` method for the `DepthWarper` class. This method calculates the projected x and y coordinates of a point from the source to the destination camera frame using a precomputed projection matrix. It takes the x and y coordinates and the inverse depth as input and returns a tensor containing the projected coordinates.
