    "result": "To create the `_compute_tiles` function, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input and Output**: \n   - Input: A batch of 2D images as a PyTorch tensor, a grid size tuple, and an optional boolean `even_tile_size`.\n   - Output: A tuple containing two tensors: one with the computed tiles and another with the padded batch of images.\n\n2. **Determine Padding Requirements**:\n   - Calculate the necessary padding to ensure that the image dimensions are divisible by the grid size.\n   - If `even_tile_size` is `True`, ensure that the tile dimensions are even.\n\n3. **Pad the Images**:\n   - Use PyTorch's padding functionality to pad the images as needed.\n\n4. **Compute the Tiles**:\n   - Divide the padded images into tiles based on the grid size.\n   - Ensure the output tensor has the shape `(B, GH, GW, C, TH, TW)`.\n\n5. **Error Handling**:\n   - Raise a `ValueError` if the grid size exceeds the image dimensions after padding.\n\nLet's implement this step by step:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef _compute_tiles(images, grid_size, even_tile_size=False):\n    # Unpack grid size\n    grid_h, grid_w = grid_size\n    \n    # Get the dimensions of the input images\n    B, C, H, W = images.shape\n    \n    # Calculate the tile size\n    tile_h = H // grid_h\n    tile_w = W // grid_w\n    \n    # Calculate padding if necessary\n    pad_h = (grid_h - H % grid_h) % grid_h\n    pad_w = (grid_w - W % grid_w) % grid_w\n    \n    # Adjust for even tile size if required\n    if even_tile_size:\n        if (tile_h + pad_h // grid_h) % 2 != 0:\n            pad_h += grid_h\n        if (tile_w + pad_w // grid_w) % 2 != 0:\n            pad_w += grid_w\n    \n    # Calculate new dimensions after padding\n    new_H = H + pad_h\n    new_W = W + pad_w\n    \n    # Raise an error if grid size exceeds image dimensions after padding\n    if grid_h > new_H or grid_w > new_W:\n        raise ValueError(\"Grid size exceeds image dimensions after padding.\")\n    \n    # Pad the images\n    padded_images = F.pad(images, (0, pad_w, 0, pad_h))\n    \n    # Calculate the new tile size\n    tile_h = new_H // grid_h\n    tile_w = new_W // grid_w\n    \n    # Reshape to get tiles\n    tiles = padded_images.unfold(2, tile_h, tile_h).unfold(3, tile_w, tile_w)\n    \n    # Rearrange dimensions to (B, GH, GW, C, TH, TW)\n    tiles = tiles.permute(0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5)\n    \n    return tiles, padded_images\n\n# Example usage:\n# images = torch.randn(2, 3, 32, 32)  # Batch of 2 images, 3 channels, 32x32 pixels\n# grid_size = (4, 4)\n# tiles, padded_images = _compute_tiles(images, grid_size, even_tile_size=True)\n```\n\nThis function will take a batch of images, pad them if necessary, and then divide them into tiles according to the specified grid size. The tiles are returned in the specified shape, and the padded images are also returned.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function _compute_tiles that takes a batch of 2D images as a PyTorch tensor, a grid size tuple representing the number of tiles to crop in each direction, and an optional boolean even_tile_size to ensure the tiles have even dimensions. The function should return a tuple containing two tensors: one with the computed tiles and another with the padded batch of images. The tile tensor should have the shape (B, GH, GW, C, TH, TW), where B is the batch size. Ensure that the image is padded appropriately if the grid size does not perfectly fit the image dimensions. Raise a ValueError if the grid size exceeds the image dimensions after padding.",
