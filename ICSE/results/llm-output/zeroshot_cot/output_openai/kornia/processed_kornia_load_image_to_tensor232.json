    "result": "To create the `_load_image_to_tensor` function, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: We'll need `torch` for tensor operations, `kornia` for image processing, and `pathlib` for handling file paths.\n\n2. **Check File Extension**: Ensure the file has a supported image extension.\n\n3. **Read and Decode the Image**: Use Kornia's Rust backend to read and decode the image.\n\n4. **Convert to Tensor**: Convert the decoded image to a PyTorch tensor.\n\n5. **Move Tensor to Device**: Ensure the tensor is moved to the specified device (CPU or GPU).\n\n6. **Return the Tensor**: Ensure the tensor has the shape `(3, H, W)`.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport torch\nimport kornia as K\nimport kornia.augmentation as KAug\nimport kornia.color as KColor\nimport kornia.geometry as KGeo\n\ndef _load_image_to_tensor(path_file: Path, device: torch.device) -> torch.Tensor:\n    # Check if the file extension is supported\n    if not path_file.suffix.lower() in ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.bmp', '.tiff']:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Unsupported image format: {path_file.suffix}\")\n\n    # Read the image using Kornia's Rust backend\n    # Note: Kornia's Rust backend is hypothetical in this context. \n    # Kornia typically uses PyTorch and OpenCV for image processing.\n    # For the purpose of this example, we'll assume Kornia can read images directly.\n    image = K.io.load_image(str(path_file), K.io.ImageLoadType.RGB32)\n\n    # Convert the image to a tensor and ensure it has the shape (3, H, W)\n    if image.ndim == 4 and image.shape[0] == 1:\n        image = image.squeeze(0)  # Remove the batch dimension if present\n\n    # Move the tensor to the specified device\n    image = image.to(device)\n\n    return image\n\n# Example usage:\n# path = Path(\"path/to/image.jpg\")\n# device = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\n# image_tensor = _load_image_to_tensor(path, device)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **File Extension Check**: We check if the file extension is one of the supported formats. If not, we raise a `ValueError`.\n\n- **Image Loading**: We use Kornia's `load_image` function to read the image. This function is assumed to handle various image formats and convert them to a tensor.\n\n- **Tensor Shape**: We ensure the tensor has the shape `(3, H, W)` by removing any unnecessary batch dimensions.\n\n- **Device Transfer**: The tensor is moved to the specified device using the `.to(device)` method.\n\nThis function assumes Kornia has the capability to load images directly, which is a hypothetical scenario for this example. In practice, Kornia typically works with images already loaded into PyTorch tensors, often using libraries like OpenCV or PIL for initial image loading.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function `_load_image_to_tensor` that reads an image file from the specified `path_file`, decodes it using the Kornia Rust backend, and converts it to a PyTorch tensor. The function takes two inputs: `path_file`, which is a `Path` object pointing to a valid image file, and `device`, which specifies the device (e.g., CPU or GPU) where the image tensor should be placed. The function returns the image as a tensor with shape `(3, H, W)`, where `H` is the height and `W` is the width of the image. The function handles image files with `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and other supported formats, raising an error if the image format is unsupported. It also ensures that the resulting tensor is moved to the specified device.",
