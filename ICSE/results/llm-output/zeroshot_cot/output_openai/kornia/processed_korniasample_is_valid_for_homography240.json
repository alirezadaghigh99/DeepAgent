    "result": "To implement the function `sample_is_valid_for_homography`, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Input Shapes**: Ensure that `points1` and `points2` have the same shape `(B, 4, 2)`.\n\n2. **Convert to Homogeneous Coordinates**: Convert the 2D points to homogeneous coordinates by appending a 1 to each point, resulting in a shape of `(B, 4, 3)`.\n\n3. **Oriented Constraint Check**: Implement the oriented constraint check as described in Marquez-Neila2015. This involves checking the orientation of the points to ensure they form a valid configuration for homography estimation.\n\n4. **Return Validity Mask**: Return a mask indicating which samples are valid for homography estimation.\n\nLet's implement this step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Check Input Shapes\n\nFirst, we need to ensure that the input tensors `points1` and `points2` have the same shape.\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef sample_is_valid_for_homography(points1, points2):\n    # Check if the shapes of points1 and points2 are equal\n    if points1.shape != points2.shape:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input tensors must have the same shape.\")\n    \n    # Check if the shape is (B, 4, 2)\n    if points1.shape[1:] != (4, 2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input tensors must have shape (B, 4, 2).\")\n    \n    B = points1.shape[0]\n    \n    # Proceed to the next step\n    return B\n```\n\n### Step 2: Convert to Homogeneous Coordinates\n\nConvert the 2D points to homogeneous coordinates.\n\n```python\ndef convert_to_homogeneous(points):\n    # Append a 1 to each point to convert to homogeneous coordinates\n    ones = torch.ones((points.shape[0], points.shape[1], 1), dtype=points.dtype, device=points.device)\n    homogeneous_points = torch.cat((points, ones), dim=-1)\n    return homogeneous_points\n```\n\n### Step 3: Oriented Constraint Check\n\nImplement the oriented constraint check. This involves checking the orientation of the points.\n\n```python\ndef oriented_constraint_check(homogeneous_points1, homogeneous_points2):\n    # Calculate cross products to determine orientation\n    def cross_product(a, b):\n        return a[..., 0] * b[..., 1] - a[..., 1] * b[..., 0]\n    \n    # Calculate vectors for orientation check\n    v1 = homogeneous_points1[:, 1] - homogeneous_points1[:, 0]\n    v2 = homogeneous_points1[:, 2] - homogeneous_points1[:, 0]\n    v3 = homogeneous_points1[:, 3] - homogeneous_points1[:, 0]\n    \n    # Calculate cross products\n    cross1 = cross_product(v1, v2)\n    cross2 = cross_product(v2, v3)\n    cross3 = cross_product(v3, v1)\n    \n    # Check if the orientation is consistent\n    valid_orientation = (cross1 * cross2 > 0) & (cross2 * cross3 > 0)\n    \n    return valid_orientation\n```\n\n### Step 4: Return Validity Mask\n\nCombine the steps to return the validity mask.\n\n```python\ndef sample_is_valid_for_homography(points1, points2):\n    # Step 1: Check input shapes\n    if points1.shape != points2.shape:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input tensors must have the same shape.\")\n    if points1.shape[1:] != (4, 2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input tensors must have shape (B, 4, 2).\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Convert to homogeneous coordinates\n    homogeneous_points1 = convert_to_homogeneous(points1)\n    homogeneous_points2 = convert_to_homogeneous(points2)\n    \n    # Step 3: Oriented constraint check\n    valid_orientation1 = oriented_constraint_check(homogeneous_points1, homogeneous_points2)\n    valid_orientation2 = oriented_constraint_check(homogeneous_points2, homogeneous_points1)\n    \n    # Step 4: Return validity mask\n    validity_mask = valid_orientation1 & valid_orientation2\n    return validity_mask\n```\n\nThis function will return a boolean tensor indicating which samples are valid for homography estimation based on the oriented constraint check.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called sample_is_valid_for_homography that implements the oriented constraint check from Marquez-Neila2015. The function takes two input tensors, points1 and points2, each with a shape of (B, 4, 2), where B is the batch size. The function returns a mask with the minimal sample that is good for homography estimation, with a shape of (B, 3, 3). The function first checks if the shapes of points1 and points2 are equal, then converts the points to homogeneous coordinates. and finally determines if the sample is valid for homography estimation. The output is a tensor representing the validity of the sample for each batch.",
