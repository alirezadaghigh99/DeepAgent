This improves numerical stability.\n- **Matrix Construction**: The `construct_matrix_A` function constructs the matrix used in the 8-point algorithm.\n- **SVD and Rank-2 Constraint**: The fundamental matrix is computed using SVD, and the rank-2 constraint is enforced by setting the smallest singular value to zero.\n- **Denormalization**: The fundamental matrix is denormalized using the inverse of the normalization transformations.\n\nThe 7-point algorithm is more complex as it can return multiple solutions, and its implementation is left as an exercise.",
