    "result": "To create a function that extracts image patches from a pyramid of images based on Local Affine Frames (LAFs), we need to follow several steps. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Normalize LAFs (Optional):** If normalization is required, we need to adjust the LAFs to ensure they are in a consistent format.\n\n2. **Create Image Pyramid:** Generate a pyramid of images at different scales. This helps in selecting the appropriate level for each LAF based on its scale.\n\n3. **Determine Pyramid Level:** For each LAF, determine the appropriate pyramid level based on its scale.\n\n4. **Extract Patches:** Using the LAFs, extract patches from the selected pyramid level.\n\n5. **Handle Edge Cases:** Ensure the function can handle cases where no patches are extracted at a particular level.\n\nLet's implement this step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Normalize LAFs (Optional)\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef normalize_lafs(laf):\n    # Normalize LAFs if needed\n    # This is a placeholder for normalization logic\n    # For example, you might want to ensure the LAFs are centered or scaled\n    return laf\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create Image Pyramid\n\n```python\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef create_image_pyramid(img, num_levels):\n    pyramid = [img]\n    for i in range(1, num_levels):\n        scaled_img = F.interpolate(img, scale_factor=1/(2**i), mode='bilinear', align_corners=False)\n        pyramid.append(scaled_img)\n    return pyramid\n```\n\n### Step 3: Determine Pyramid Level\n\n```python\ndef determine_pyramid_level(laf, num_levels):\n    # Determine the appropriate pyramid level for each LAF\n    # This is a placeholder logic; you might use the determinant of the affine part of LAF\n    scales = torch.sqrt(torch.det(laf[:, :, :2, :2]))\n    levels = torch.clamp((scales.log2().round().int()), 0, num_levels - 1)\n    return levels\n```\n\n### Step 4: Extract Patches\n\n```python\ndef extract_patches_from_pyramid(img_pyramid, laf, patch_size):\n    B, N, _, _ = laf.shape\n    patches = torch.zeros((B, N, img_pyramid[0].shape[1], patch_size, patch_size), device=img_pyramid[0].device)\n    \n    for b in range(B):\n        for n in range(N):\n            level = determine_pyramid_level(laf[b:b+1, n:n+1], len(img_pyramid))[0, 0]\n            img_level = img_pyramid[level]\n            # Extract patch using affine grid and grid_sample\n            affine_matrix = laf[b, n, :, :].unsqueeze(0)\n            grid = F.affine_grid(affine_matrix, torch.Size((1, img_level.shape[1], patch_size, patch_size)), align_corners=False)\n            patch = F.grid_sample(img_level[b:b+1], grid, align_corners=False)\n            patches[b, n] = patch.squeeze(0)\n    \n    return patches\n```\n\n### Step 5: Handle Edge Cases\n\nThe above code inherently handles cases where no patches are extracted at a particular level by iterating over each LAF and selecting the appropriate level. However, if you want to optimize further, you can add checks to skip levels with no LAFs.\n\n### Final Function\n\nNow, let's combine everything into a single function:\n\n```python\ndef extract_image_patches(img, laf, patch_size=32, num_levels=3, normalize=False):\n    if normalize:\n        laf = normalize_lafs(laf)\n    \n    img_pyramid = create_image_pyramid(img, num_levels)\n    patches = extract_patches_from_pyramid(img_pyramid, laf, patch_size)\n    \n    return patches\n```\n\nThis function will take an image tensor and LAFs, optionally normalize the LAFs, create an image pyramid, and extract patches at the appropriate pyramid level. The patches are returned as a tensor of shape `(B, N, CH, PS, PS)`.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function that extracts image patches from a pyramid of images based on input Local Affine Frames (LAFs). The function should take as input an image tensor `img` of shape `(B, CH, H, W)` and LAFs `laf` of shape `(B, N, 2, 3)`. Optionally, normalize the LAFs before extraction. The function should return a tensor of extracted patches of shape `(B, N, CH, PS, PS)`. The extraction should be done at the appropriate pyramid level based on the scale of each LAF. Ensure that the function handles various cases, such as when no patches need to be extracted at a particular pyramid level.",
