    "result": "To generate the `right_jacobian` function for computing the right Jacobian of SO(3), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the `vector_to_skew_symmetric_matrix` function**: This function converts a 3D vector into a skew-symmetric matrix.\n\n2. **Compute the norm of the input vector**: Use `torch.norm` to compute the magnitude of the input vector.\n\n3. **Calculate the right Jacobian matrix**: Use the skew-symmetric matrix, the identity matrix, and matrix multiplication to compute the right Jacobian.\n\nLet's implement these steps in the function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef vector_to_skew_symmetric_matrix(vec):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert a 3D vector to a skew-symmetric matrix.\n    \n    Args:\n        vec (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (3,).\n        \n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: A 3x3 skew-symmetric matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    return torch.tensor([\n        [0, -vec[2], vec[1]],\n        [vec[2], 0, -vec[0]],\n        [-vec[1], vec[0], 0]\n    ], dtype=vec.dtype, device=vec.device)\n\ndef right_jacobian(vec):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the right Jacobian of SO(3) for a given vector.\n    \n    Args:\n        vec (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, 3).\n        \n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: A tensor of shape (B, 3, 3) representing the right Jacobian matrices.\n    \"\"\"\n    B = vec.shape[0]\n    right_jacobians = torch.zeros((B, 3, 3), dtype=vec.dtype, device=vec.device)\n    \n    for i in range(B):\n        v = vec[i]\n        theta = torch.norm(v)\n        if theta < 1e-8:\n            right_jacobians[i] = torch.eye(3, dtype=vec.dtype, device=vec.device)\n        else:\n            v_skew = vector_to_skew_symmetric_matrix(v)\n            I = torch.eye(3, dtype=vec.dtype, device=vec.device)\n            term1 = (1 - torch.cos(theta)) / (theta ** 2) * v_skew\n            term2 = (theta - torch.sin(theta)) / (theta ** 3) * (v_skew @ v_skew)\n            right_jacobians[i] = I + term1 + term2\n    \n    return right_jacobians\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`vector_to_skew_symmetric_matrix`**: This function takes a 3D vector and returns its corresponding skew-symmetric matrix.\n\n- **`right_jacobian`**: This function computes the right Jacobian for each vector in the batch. It handles the case where the norm of the vector is very small (close to zero) by returning the identity matrix, which is a common approximation for small angles. For other cases, it computes the right Jacobian using the formula involving the skew-symmetric matrix and trigonometric functions.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input tensor `vec` is of shape `(B, 3)`, where `B` is the batch size. The output is a tensor of shape `(B, 3, 3)`, where each 3x3 matrix is the right Jacobian for the corresponding input vector.",
