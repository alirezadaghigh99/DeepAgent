    "result": "To create the `fundamental_from_projections` function, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: We'll use PyTorch for tensor operations, so we need to import it.\n\n2. **Define the Function**: We'll create a function named `fundamental_from_projections` that takes two projection matrices `P1` and `P2` as input.\n\n3. **Input Validation**: We'll ensure that both `P1` and `P2` have the correct shape of `(*, 3, 4)` and that their batch dimensions match. If not, we'll raise an `AssertionError`.\n\n4. **Data Type Handling**: We'll convert the inputs to `torch.float32` if they are not already in `float32` or `float64`.\n\n5. **Compute the Fundamental Matrix**: We'll compute the fundamental matrix using the determinants of specific submatrices derived from the input projections.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we'll return the computed fundamental matrix.\n\nLet's implement this step by step:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef fundamental_from_projections(P1, P2):\n    # Ensure the input tensors are of the correct shape\n    assert P1.shape[-2:] == (3, 4), \"P1 must have shape (*, 3, 4)\"\n    assert P2.shape[-2:] == (3, 4), \"P2 must have shape (*, 3, 4)\"\n    assert P1.shape[:-2] == P2.shape[:-2], \"Batch dimensions of P1 and P2 must match\"\n    \n    # Convert inputs to float32 if they are not float32 or float64\n    if P1.dtype not in [torch.float32, torch.float64]:\n        P1 = P1.to(torch.float32)\n    if P2.dtype not in [torch.float32, torch.float64]:\n        P2 = P2.to(torch.float32)\n    \n    # Extract the submatrices from P1 and P2\n    def submatrix(P, i):\n        # Remove the i-th column from P\n        return torch.cat((P[..., :i], P[..., i+1:]), dim=-1)\n    \n    # Compute the determinants of the submatrices\n    def determinant_3x3(M):\n        # Compute the determinant of a 3x3 matrix\n        return torch.det(M)\n    \n    # Initialize the fundamental matrix tensor\n    F = torch.zeros(P1.shape[:-2] + (3, 3), dtype=P1.dtype, device=P1.device)\n    \n    # Compute the fundamental matrix using determinants of submatrices\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            M1 = submatrix(P1, i)\n            M2 = submatrix(P2, j)\n            F[..., i, j] = determinant_3x3(torch.cat((M1, M2), dim=-1))\n    \n    return F\n\n# Example usage:\n# P1 = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)  # Example batch of projection matrices\n# P2 = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)\n# F = fundamental_from_projections(P1, P2)\n# print(F.shape)  # Should print (2, 3, 3)\n```\n\nThis function will compute the fundamental matrix for each pair of projection matrices in the batch. The use of submatrices and determinants is a common method in computer vision to derive the fundamental matrix from projection matrices.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function named `fundamental_from_projections` that calculates the fundamental matrix from two projection matrices (`P1` and `P2`). The function should ensure that both projection matrices have the correct shape of `(*, 3, 4)` and matching batch dimensions, raising an `AssertionError` if these conditions are not met. The function computes the fundamental matrix using the determinants of specific submatrices derived from the input projections and returns a tensor of shape `(*, 3, 3)`. The function should handle different data types, converting the inputs to `torch.float32` if they are not already in `float32` or `float64`.",
