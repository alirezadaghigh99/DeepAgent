    "result": "To implement the `__init__` function for the `Normalize` class, we need to ensure that the `mean` and `std` parameters are converted to PyTorch tensors if they are not already. We will also store these converted tensors as attributes of the class. Here's how you can implement this step by step:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Modules**: Ensure that the necessary modules are imported. Since we are dealing with PyTorch tensors, we need to import `torch`.\n\n2. **Check and Convert `mean` and `std`**: We need to check if `mean` and `std` are already tensors. If not, we convert them to tensors using `torch.tensor()`.\n\n3. **Store as Class Attributes**: Once converted, store these tensors as attributes of the class.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import nn\nfrom typing import Union, Tuple, List\n\nclass Normalize(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        mean: Union[torch.Tensor, Tuple[float], List[float], float],\n        std: Union[torch.Tensor, Tuple[float], List[float], float],\n    ) -> None:\n        super().__init__()\n        \n        # Convert mean to a tensor if it is not already\n        if not isinstance(mean, torch.Tensor):\n            mean = torch.tensor(mean, dtype=torch.float32)\n        \n        # Convert std to a tensor if it is not already\n        if not isinstance(std, torch.Tensor):\n            std = torch.tensor(std, dtype=torch.float32)\n        \n        # Store the mean and std as class attributes\n        self.mean = mean\n        self.std = std\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Imports**: We import `torch` for tensor operations and `nn` from `torch` for the module base class. We also import `Union`, `Tuple`, and `List` from `typing` for type hinting.\n\n- **Type Checking and Conversion**: We check if `mean` and `std` are instances of `torch.Tensor`. If not, we convert them using `torch.tensor()`, specifying `dtype=torch.float32` to ensure they are floating-point tensors.\n\n- **Attribute Assignment**: The converted tensors are assigned to `self.mean` and `self.std`, making them accessible throughout the class.\n\nThis setup ensures that the `Normalize` class can handle different input types for `mean` and `std`, providing flexibility in how these parameters are specified.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python `__init__` function for the `Normalize` class, which initializes a normalization module that normalizes a tensor image with a given mean and standard deviation. The function accepts `mean` and `std`, which can be a tensor, tuple, list, or float. The `mean` and `std` values are converted to tensors if they are not already, and are then stored as attributes of the class.\n\n```python\nclass Normalize(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        mean: Union[torch.Tensor, Tuple[float], List[float], float],\n        std: Union[torch.Tensor, Tuple[float], List[float], float],\n    ) -> None:\n        super().__init__()\n```\n\nThis function checks the types of `mean` and `std`, converts them to tensors if necessary, and assigns them to `self.mean` and `self.std`.",
