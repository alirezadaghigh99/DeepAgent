    "result": "To create the `unproject_points_z1` function, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input and Output**: \n   - The input `points_in_cam_canonical` is a tensor of shape `(..., 2)`, representing 2D points on the z=1 plane.\n   - The optional input `extension` is a tensor of shape `(..., 1)`, representing the depth or extension of each point.\n   - The output should be a tensor of shape `(..., 3)`, representing the 3D points in the camera frame.\n\n2. **Unprojection Logic**:\n   - For each 2D point `(x, y)` on the z=1 plane, the corresponding 3D point in the camera frame can be calculated as `(x * z, y * z, z)`, where `z` is the depth or extension.\n   - If `extension` is not provided, assume `z = 1` for all points.\n\n3. **Implementation**:\n   - Use PyTorch for tensor operations.\n   - Handle the case where `extension` is not provided by defaulting to a tensor of ones.\n\nHere's the step-by-step implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef unproject_points_z1(points_in_cam_canonical, extension=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Unprojects points from the canonical z=1 plane into the camera frame.\n\n    Args:\n        points_in_cam_canonical (Tensor): A tensor of shape (..., 2) representing the 2D points.\n        extension (Tensor, optional): A tensor of shape (..., 1) representing the depth of the points.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor: A tensor of shape (..., 3) representing the unprojected 3D points.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure points_in_cam_canonical is a tensor\n    if not isinstance(points_in_cam_canonical, torch.Tensor):\n        raise TypeError(\"points_in_cam_canonical must be a torch.Tensor\")\n\n    # If extension is not provided, assume z = 1 for all points\n    if extension is None:\n        extension = torch.ones(points_in_cam_canonical.shape[:-1] + (1,), dtype=points_in_cam_canonical.dtype, device=points_in_cam_canonical.device)\n\n    # Ensure extension is a tensor\n    if not isinstance(extension, torch.Tensor):\n        raise TypeError(\"extension must be a torch.Tensor\")\n\n    # Concatenate the points with the extension to form 3D points\n    unprojected_points = torch.cat((points_in_cam_canonical * extension, extension), dim=-1)\n\n    return unprojected_points\n\n# Example usage\npoints = torch.tensor([[0.5, 0.5], [1.0, 1.0]])\nextension = torch.tensor([[2.0], [3.0]])\nunprojected_points = unproject_points_z1(points, extension)\nprint(unprojected_points)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Validation**: The function checks if the inputs are tensors.\n- **Default Extension**: If `extension` is not provided, it defaults to a tensor of ones with the appropriate shape.\n- **Concatenation**: The 2D points are multiplied by the extension to scale them, and then concatenated with the extension to form the 3D points.\n- **Example Usage**: Demonstrates how to use the function with sample tensors.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called unproject_points_z1 that unprojects one or more points from the canonical z=1 plane into the camera frame. The function takes in a Tensor called points_in_cam_canonical representing the points to unproject with shape (..., 2) and an optional Tensor called extension representing the extension (depth) of the points with shape (..., 1). The function returns a Tensor representing the unprojected points with shape (..., 3). An example usage of the function is provided where points and extension are tensors, and the output is a tensor of unprojected points.",
