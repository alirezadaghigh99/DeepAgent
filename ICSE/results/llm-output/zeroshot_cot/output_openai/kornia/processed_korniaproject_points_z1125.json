    "result": "To create the `project_points_z1` function, we need to perform perspective division on the input points. This involves dividing the x and y coordinates by the z coordinate to project the points onto the z=1 plane. Let's break down the steps to implement this function:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: We'll use PyTorch for tensor operations, so we need to import it.\n\n2. **Define the Function**: We'll define a function `project_points_z1` that takes a tensor `points_in_camera` as input.\n\n3. **Perform Perspective Division**: For each point, divide the x and y coordinates by the z coordinate to project onto the z=1 plane.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: The function should return a tensor with the projected points.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef project_points_z1(points_in_camera):\n    \"\"\"\n    Projects points from the camera frame into the canonical z=1 plane.\n    \n    Args:\n        points_in_camera (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (..., 3) representing the points to project.\n        \n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: A tensor of shape (..., 2) representing the projected points.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure the input is a tensor\n    if not isinstance(points_in_camera, torch.Tensor):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a torch.Tensor\")\n    \n    # Check that the last dimension is 3\n    if points_in_camera.shape[-1] != 3:\n        raise ValueError(\"The last dimension of points_in_camera must be 3\")\n    \n    # Extract x, y, z components\n    x = points_in_camera[..., 0]\n    y = points_in_camera[..., 1]\n    z = points_in_camera[..., 2]\n    \n    # Perform perspective division\n    x_proj = x / z\n    y_proj = y / z\n    \n    # Stack the results to get the final projected points\n    projected_points = torch.stack((x_proj, y_proj), dim=-1)\n    \n    return projected_points\n\n# Example usage\npoints = torch.tensor([1., 2., 3.])\nprint(project_points_z1(points))  # Output: tensor([0.3333, 0.6667])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Input Validation**: The function checks if the input is a tensor and if the last dimension is 3, which is necessary for the x, y, z coordinates.\n\n- **Perspective Division**: The x and y coordinates are divided by the z coordinate to project the points onto the z=1 plane.\n\n- **Output**: The function returns a tensor with the projected x and y coordinates.\n\nThis function will work for any shape of input tensor as long as the last dimension is 3, allowing for batch processing of multiple points.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called project_points_z1 that projects one or more points from the camera frame into the canonical z=1 plane through perspective division. The input is a tensor called points_in_camera with shape (..., 3) representing the points to project. The function has a precondition that the points are in front of the camera (z > 0). If this is not the case, the points will be projected to the canonical plane, but the resulting points will be behind the camera and may cause numerical issues for z == 0. The output is a tensor representing the projected points with shape (..., 2). An example usage of the function is as follows:\n\n```python\npoints = torch.tensor([1., 2., 3.])\nproject_points_z1(points)\n```\n\nThis will return a tensor with values [0.3333, 0.6667].",
