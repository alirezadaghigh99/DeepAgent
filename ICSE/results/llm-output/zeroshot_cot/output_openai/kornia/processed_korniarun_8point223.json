    "result": "To compute the fundamental matrix using the 8-point algorithm with a weighted least squares solution, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Normalize the Points**: This involves translating and scaling the points so that their centroid is at the origin and their average distance from the origin is \u221a2. This step helps improve numerical stability.\n\n2. **Construct the Design Matrix**: For each pair of corresponding points, construct a row in the design matrix.\n\n3. **Apply Weights**: Incorporate the weights into the design matrix.\n\n4. **Solve the Linear System**: Use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to solve the linear system and find the fundamental matrix.\n\n5. **Enforce Rank-2 Constraint**: The fundamental matrix must be of rank 2, so we enforce this constraint by setting the smallest singular value to zero.\n\n6. **Denormalize the Fundamental Matrix**: Transform the fundamental matrix back to the original coordinate system.\n\nLet's implement this step by step in the `run_8point` function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef normalize_points(points):\n    \"\"\"Normalize a set of points so that the centroid is at the origin and the average distance is \u221a2.\"\"\"\n    centroid = points.mean(dim=1, keepdim=True)\n    centered_points = points - centroid\n    scale = torch.sqrt(2.0) / torch.mean(torch.norm(centered_points, dim=2), dim=1, keepdim=True)\n    normalized_points = centered_points * scale.unsqueeze(-1)\n    T = torch.zeros((points.shape[0], 3, 3), device=points.device)\n    T[:, 0, 0] = scale.squeeze()\n    T[:, 1, 1] = scale.squeeze()\n    T[:, 0, 2] = -scale.squeeze() * centroid[:, 0, 0]\n    T[:, 1, 2] = -scale.squeeze() * centroid[:, 0, 1]\n    T[:, 2, 2] = 1.0\n    return normalized_points, T\n\ndef construct_design_matrix(points1, points2, weights):\n    \"\"\"Construct the design matrix A for the weighted 8-point algorithm.\"\"\"\n    B, N, _ = points1.shape\n    A = torch.zeros((B, N, 9), device=points1.device)\n    x1, y1 = points1[:, :, 0], points1[:, :, 1]\n    x2, y2 = points2[:, :, 0], points2[:, :, 1]\n    A[:, :, 0] = weights * x2 * x1\n    A[:, :, 1] = weights * x2 * y1\n    A[:, :, 2] = weights * x2\n    A[:, :, 3] = weights * y2 * x1\n    A[:, :, 4] = weights * y2 * y1\n    A[:, :, 5] = weights * y2\n    A[:, :, 6] = weights * x1\n    A[:, :, 7] = weights * y1\n    A[:, :, 8] = weights\n    return A\n\ndef enforce_rank2_constraint(F):\n    \"\"\"Enforce the rank-2 constraint on the fundamental matrix.\"\"\"\n    U, S, Vt = torch.svd(F)\n    S[:, -1] = 0\n    return U @ torch.diag_embed(S) @ Vt\n\ndef run_8point(points1, points2, weights):\n    \"\"\"Compute the fundamental matrix using the weighted 8-point algorithm.\"\"\"\n    # Normalize points\n    points1_normalized, T1 = normalize_points(points1)\n    points2_normalized, T2 = normalize_points(points2)\n\n    # Construct the design matrix\n    A = construct_design_matrix(points1_normalized, points2_normalized, weights)\n\n    # Solve the linear system using SVD\n    _, _, Vt = torch.svd(A)\n    F_normalized = Vt[:, -1].view(-1, 3, 3)\n\n    # Enforce rank-2 constraint\n    F_normalized = enforce_rank2_constraint(F_normalized)\n\n    # Denormalize the fundamental matrix\n    F = T2.transpose(1, 2) @ F_normalized @ T1\n\n    return F\n```\n\nThis function should compute the fundamental matrix for each batch of point correspondences using the weighted 8-point algorithm.
