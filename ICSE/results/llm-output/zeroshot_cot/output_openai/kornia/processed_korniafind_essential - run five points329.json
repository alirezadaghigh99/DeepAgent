    "result": "To create the `run_5point` function that computes the essential matrix using Nister's 5-point algorithm, we need to follow several steps. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries\n\nFirst, we need to import the necessary libraries. We'll use PyTorch for tensor operations.\n\n```python\nimport torch\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the Function Signature\n\nDefine the function signature with the required parameters: two tensors of calibrated points and an optional weights tensor.\n\n```python\ndef run_5point(points1, points2, weights=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the essential matrix using Nister's 5-point algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        points1 (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, N, 2) representing calibrated points from the first image.\n        points2 (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, N, 2) representing calibrated points from the second image.\n        weights (torch.Tensor, optional): A tensor of shape (B, N) representing weights for each point pair.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: A tensor of shape (B, 3, 3) representing the essential matrix for each batch.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Validate input shapes\n    if points1.shape != points2.shape:\n        raise ValueError(\"points1 and points2 must have the same shape.\")\n    if weights is not None and weights.shape != points1.shape[:-1]:\n        raise ValueError(\"weights must have the shape (B, N).\")\n```\n\n### Step 3: Construct the Linear System\n\nConstruct the linear system required for the 5-point algorithm. This involves creating a matrix `A` from the point correspondences.\n\n```python\n    B, N, _ = points1.shape\n\n    # Prepare the linear system matrix A\n    A = torch.zeros((B, N, 9), dtype=points1.dtype, device=points1.device)\n\n    # Fill the matrix A with the point correspondences\n    x1, y1 = points1[..., 0], points1[..., 1]\n    x2, y2 = points2[..., 0], points2[..., 1]\n\n    A[..., 0] = x2 * x1\n    A[..., 1] = x2 * y1\n    A[..., 2] = x2\n    A[..., 3] = y2 * x1\n    A[..., 4] = y2 * y1\n    A[..., 5] = y2\n    A[..., 6] = x1\n    A[..., 7] = y1\n    A[..., 8] = 1\n```\n\n### Step 4: Apply Weights (if provided)\n\nIf weights are provided, apply them to the matrix `A`.\n\n```python\n    if weights is not None:\n        A *= weights.unsqueeze(-1)\n```\n\n### Step 5: Solve for the Essential Matrix\n\nSolve the linear system to find the essential matrix. This typically involves using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).\n\n```python\n    # Solve the linear system using SVD\n    _, _, V = torch.svd(A)\n\n    # The solution is the last column of V (corresponding to the smallest singular value)\n    E = V[..., -1].reshape(B, 3, 3)\n```\n\n### Step 6: Return the Essential Matrix\n\nFinally, return the computed essential matrix.\n\n```python\n    return E\n```\n\n### Complete Function\n\nHere is the complete function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef run_5point(points1, points2, weights=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the essential matrix using Nister's 5-point algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        points1 (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, N, 2) representing calibrated points from the first image.\n        points2 (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, N, 2) representing calibrated points from the second image.\n        weights (torch.Tensor, optional): A tensor of shape (B, N) representing weights for each point pair.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: A tensor of shape (B, 3, 3) representing the essential matrix for each batch.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Validate input shapes\n    if points1.shape != points2.shape:\n        raise ValueError(\"points1 and points2 must have the same shape.\")\n    if weights is not None and weights.shape != points1.shape[:-1]:\n        raise ValueError(\"weights must have the shape (B, N).\")\n\n    B, N, _ = points1.shape\n\n    # Prepare the linear system matrix A\n    A = torch.zeros((B, N, 9), dtype=points1.dtype, device=points1.device)\n\n    # Fill the matrix A with the point correspondences\n    x1, y1 = points1[..., 0], points1[..., 1]\n    x2, y2 = points2[..., 0], points2[..., 1]\n\n    A[..., 0] = x2 * x1\n    A[..., 1] = x2 * y1\n    A[..., 2] = x2\n    A[..., 3] = y2 * x1\n    A[..., 4] = y2 * y1\n    A[..., 5] = y2\n    A[..., 6] = x1\n    A[..., 7] = y1\n    A[..., 8] = 1\n\n    # Apply weights if provided\n    if weights is not None:\n        A *= weights.unsqueeze(-1)\n\n    # Solve the linear system using SVD\n    _, _, V = torch.svd(A)\n\n    # The solution is the last column of V (corresponding to the smallest singular value)\n    E = V[..., -1].reshape(B, 3, 3)\n\n    return E\n```\n\nThis function should compute the essential matrix for each batch using the 5-point algorithm. Note that this is a simplified version and may require additional steps for a complete implementation, such as enforcing the rank-2 constraint on the essential matrix.",
