    "result": "To implement the `forward` method for the `DiceLoss` class, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the Class**: Ensure the class is properly initialized with the necessary parameters: `average`, `eps`, and `weight`.\n\n2. **Input Validation**: Validate the inputs to ensure they are of the correct shape and type.\n\n3. **One-Hot Encoding**: Convert the target labels to one-hot encoding if they are not already.\n\n4. **Dice Coefficient Calculation**: Compute the Dice coefficient for each class.\n\n5. **Reduction Method**: Apply the specified reduction method (`'micro'` or `'macro'`).\n\n6. **Return the Dice Loss**: Return the computed Dice loss.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass DiceLoss(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, average: str = \"micro\", eps: float = 1e-8, weight: Optional[Tensor] = None) -> None:\n        super(DiceLoss, self).__init__()\n        self.average = average\n        self.eps = eps\n        self.weight = weight\n\n    def forward(self, pred: Tensor, target: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # Ensure predictions are probabilities\n        pred = torch.softmax(pred, dim=1)\n        \n        # Convert target to one-hot encoding\n        num_classes = pred.shape[1]\n        target_one_hot = torch.nn.functional.one_hot(target, num_classes=num_classes).permute(0, 3, 1, 2).float()\n        \n        # Calculate intersection and union\n        intersection = torch.sum(pred * target_one_hot, dim=(2, 3))\n        union = torch.sum(pred, dim=(2, 3)) + torch.sum(target_one_hot, dim=(2, 3))\n        \n        # Calculate Dice coefficient\n        dice_score = (2.0 * intersection + self.eps) / (union + self.eps)\n        \n        # Apply class weights if provided\n        if self.weight is not None:\n            dice_score = dice_score * self.weight.view(1, -1)\n        \n        # Calculate Dice loss\n        dice_loss = 1 - dice_score\n        \n        # Apply reduction method\n        if self.average == 'micro':\n            dice_loss = dice_loss.mean()\n        elif self.average == 'macro':\n            dice_loss = dice_loss.mean(dim=1).mean()\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"average must be either 'micro' or 'macro'\")\n        \n        return dice_loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Softmax**: We apply `softmax` to the predictions to ensure they are probabilities.\n- **One-Hot Encoding**: The target is converted to one-hot encoding to match the shape of the predictions.\n- **Intersection and Union**: These are calculated for each class to compute the Dice coefficient.\n- **Dice Coefficient**: The formula `(2 * intersection + eps) / (union + eps)` is used for numerical stability.\n- **Class Weights**: If provided, class weights are applied to the Dice scores.\n- **Reduction**: The `'micro'` reduction averages the loss across all classes, while `'macro'` averages the loss for each class separately and then averages across classes.\n\nThis implementation should work for multi-class segmentation tasks, providing flexibility with reduction methods and class weighting.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `forward` for the `DiceLoss` class that computes the S\u00f8rensen-Dice Coefficient loss for multi-class segmentation tasks. The method should take as input the predicted scores `pred` and the ground truth labels `target`, and return the computed Dice loss. The method should support two reduction methods: `'micro'` (calculates the loss across all classes) and `'macro'` (calculates the loss for each class separately and averages the loss across classes). The loss should also include options for numerical stability with `eps` and class weighting with `weight`.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass DiceLoss(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, average: str = \"micro\", eps: float = 1e-8, weight: Optional[Tensor] = None) -> None:\n        self.average = average\n        self.eps = eps\n        self.weight = weight\n\n    def forward(self, pred: Tensor, target: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
