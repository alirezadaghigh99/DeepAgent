    "result": "To implement the `forward` method for the `Rot180` class, we need to rotate the input tensor by 180 degrees. This can be achieved by flipping the tensor both vertically and horizontally. In PyTorch, this can be done using the `torch.flip` function.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `forward` method:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom torch.nn import Module\n\nclass Rot180(Module):\n    def forward(self, input: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # Flip the tensor along the height and width dimensions\n        if input.dim() == 3:\n            # If the input is of shape (C, H, W)\n            return torch.flip(input, dims=[1, 2])\n        elif input.dim() >= 4:\n            # If the input is a batch of tensors of shape (*, C, H, W)\n            return torch.flip(input, dims=[-2, -1])\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Input tensor must have at least 3 dimensions (C, H, W) or be a batch of such tensors.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Dimensions**:\n   - The input tensor can be either a single image with shape `(C, H, W)` or a batch of images with shape `(*, C, H, W)`.\n   - We need to handle both cases.\n\n2. **Flipping the Tensor**:\n   - For a single image `(C, H, W)`, we flip along dimensions 1 and 2, which correspond to `H` and `W`.\n   - For a batch of images `(*, C, H, W)`, we flip along the last two dimensions, `-2` and `-1`, which correspond to `H` and `W`.\n\n3. **Error Handling**:\n   - If the input tensor does not have at least 3 dimensions, we raise a `ValueError` because the input does not conform to the expected shape.\n\nThis implementation efficiently rotates the input tensor by 180 degrees using the `torch.flip` function, which is well-suited for this task.",
