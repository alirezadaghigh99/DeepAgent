    "result": "To generate the `projection_from_KRt` function, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Validate Input Shapes**: Ensure that the input matrices `K`, `R`, and `t` have the correct shapes as specified in the function description.\n\n2. **Concatenate R and t**: Form the matrix `[R|t]` by concatenating the rotation matrix `R` and the translation vector `t` along the last axis.\n\n3. **Compute the Projection Matrix**: Multiply the camera matrix `K` with the concatenated matrix `[R|t]` to get the projection matrix `P`.\n\n4. **Return the Projection Matrix**: Ensure the output matrix `P` has the correct shape `(B, 4, 4)`.\n\nHere's the complete code for the function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\n\ndef projection_from_KRt(K: Tensor, R: Tensor, t: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n    # Validate input shapes\n    if K.shape[-2:] != (3, 3):\n        raise AssertionError(f\"Expected K to have shape (B, 3, 3), but got {K.shape}\")\n    if R.shape[-2:] != (3, 3):\n        raise AssertionError(f\"Expected R to have shape (B, 3, 3), but got {R.shape}\")\n    if t.shape[-2:] != (3, 1):\n        raise AssertionError(f\"Expected t to have shape (B, 3, 1), but got {t.shape}\")\n    if not len(K.shape) == len(R.shape) == len(t.shape):\n        raise AssertionError(\"K, R, and t must have the same number of dimensions\")\n\n    # Concatenate R and t to form [R|t]\n    Rt = torch.cat((R, t), dim=-1)  # Shape: (B, 3, 4)\n\n    # Compute the projection matrix P\n    P = torch.bmm(K, Rt)  # Shape: (B, 3, 4)\n\n    # Add a row [0, 0, 0, 1] to make P a 4x4 matrix\n    batch_size = P.shape[0]\n    bottom_row = torch.tensor([0, 0, 0, 1], dtype=P.dtype, device=P.device).view(1, 1, 4)\n    bottom_row = bottom_row.expand(batch_size, 1, 4)  # Shape: (B, 1, 4)\n    P = torch.cat((P, bottom_row), dim=1)  # Shape: (B, 4, 4)\n\n    return P\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Validation**: The function checks if the input matrices have the expected shapes. If not, it raises an `AssertionError` with a descriptive message.\n- **Concatenation**: The rotation matrix `R` and translation vector `t` are concatenated to form a single matrix `[R|t]`.\n- **Matrix Multiplication**: The camera matrix `K` is multiplied with `[R|t]` using batch matrix multiplication (`torch.bmm`) to compute the projection matrix `P`.\n- **Output Shape**: The function ensures that the output `P` is a 4x4 matrix by appending a row `[0, 0, 0, 1]` to each batch.",
