    "result": "To create a function `_jpeg_encode` that performs JPEG encoding on a batch of RGB images, we need to follow several steps. JPEG encoding involves several stages, including color space conversion, downsampling, block splitting, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), quantization, and entropy encoding. For simplicity, we'll focus on the main steps up to quantization, as entropy encoding (like Huffman coding) is more complex and typically handled by specialized libraries.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:\n\n1. **Color Space Conversion**: Convert the RGB images to YCbCr color space.\n2. **Downsampling**: Downsample the Cb and Cr channels if necessary (commonly done in JPEG).\n3. **Block Splitting**: Split the image into 8x8 blocks.\n4. **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)**: Apply DCT to each 8x8 block.\n5. **Quantization**: Quantize the DCT coefficients using the provided quantization tables.\n\nLet's implement these steps in the `_jpeg_encode` function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef rgb_to_ycbcr(image_rgb):\n    # Convert RGB to YCbCr\n    matrix = torch.tensor([[0.299, 0.587, 0.114],\n                           [-0.1687, -0.3313, 0.5],\n                           [0.5, -0.4187, -0.0813]], dtype=image_rgb.dtype, device=image_rgb.device)\n    shift = torch.tensor([0, 128, 128], dtype=image_rgb.dtype, device=image_rgb.device)\n    image_ycbcr = torch.tensordot(image_rgb.permute(0, 2, 3, 1), matrix, dims=1) + shift\n    return image_ycbcr.permute(0, 3, 1, 2)\n\ndef block_split(image, block_size=8):\n    # Split image into non-overlapping blocks of size block_size x block_size\n    B, C, H, W = image.shape\n    image = image.unfold(2, block_size, block_size).unfold(3, block_size, block_size)\n    return image.contiguous().view(B, C, -1, block_size, block_size)\n\ndef dct_2d(block):\n    # Apply 2D DCT to each block\n    return torch.fft.fft2(block, norm='ortho')\n\ndef quantize(block, quantization_table):\n    # Quantize the DCT coefficients\n    return torch.round(block / quantization_table)\n\ndef _jpeg_encode(image_rgb, jpeg_quality, quantization_table_y, quantization_table_c):\n    # Convert RGB to YCbCr\n    image_ycbcr = rgb_to_ycbcr(image_rgb)\n    y, cb, cr = image_ycbcr[:, 0, :, :], image_ycbcr[:, 1, :, :], image_ycbcr[:, 2, :, :]\n\n    # Downsample Cb and Cr (optional, commonly 2x2 downsampling)\n    cb = F.avg_pool2d(cb, kernel_size=2, stride=2)\n    cr = F.avg_pool2d(cr, kernel_size=2, stride=2)\n\n    # Split into 8x8 blocks\n    y_blocks = block_split(y)\n    cb_blocks = block_split(cb)\n    cr_blocks = block_split(cr)\n\n    # Apply DCT\n    y_dct = dct_2d(y_blocks)\n    cb_dct = dct_2d(cb_blocks)\n    cr_dct = dct_2d(cr_blocks)\n\n    # Quantize\n    y_encoded = quantize(y_dct, quantization_table_y)\n    cb_encoded = quantize(cb_dct, quantization_table_c)\n    cr_encoded = quantize(cr_dct, quantization_table_c)\n\n    return y_encoded, cb_encoded, cr_encoded\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Color Space Conversion**: The `rgb_to_ycbcr` function converts the RGB image to YCbCr using a linear transformation.\n- **Block Splitting**: The `block_split` function divides the image into 8x8 blocks.\n- **DCT**: The `dct_2d` function applies a 2D DCT to each block using the FFT-based method.\n- **Quantization**: The `quantize` function quantizes the DCT coefficients using the provided quantization tables.\n\nThis code provides a basic framework for JPEG encoding up to the quantization step. Note that this implementation does not include entropy encoding, which is a crucial part of JPEG compression. For a complete JPEG encoder, you would need to implement or use a library for entropy encoding (e.g., Huffman coding).",
