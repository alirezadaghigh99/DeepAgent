    "result": "To calculate the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss between two heatmaps, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Ensure Valid Probability Distributions**: The input tensors should represent valid probability distributions. This means that the values should be non-negative and sum to 1 across the appropriate dimensions.\n\n2. **Compute the KL Divergence**: The KL divergence for discrete distributions \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   D_{KL}(P \\parallel Q) = \\sum_i P(i) \\log\\left(\\frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}\\right)\n   \\]\n   In the context of tensors, this operation needs to be applied element-wise.\n\n3. **Apply Reduction**: Depending on the `reduction` parameter, we either return the element-wise divergence, the mean divergence, or the sum of all divergences.\n\nLet's write the code for this:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef kl_div_loss_2d(pred, target, reduction='mean'):\n    # Ensure the input tensors are valid probability distributions\n    pred = pred / pred.sum(dim=(2, 3), keepdim=True)\n    target = target / target.sum(dim=(2, 3), keepdim=True)\n    \n    # Compute the KL divergence\n    kl_div = target * (torch.log(target + 1e-10) - torch.log(pred + 1e-10))\n    kl_div = kl_div.sum(dim=(2, 3))  # Sum over H and W dimensions\n    \n    # Apply the specified reduction\n    if reduction == 'mean':\n        return kl_div.mean()\n    elif reduction == 'sum':\n        return kl_div.sum()\n    elif reduction == 'none':\n        return kl_div\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Invalid reduction type: {reduction}\")\n\n# Example usage\npred = torch.full((1, 1, 2, 4), 0.125)\nloss = kl_div_loss_2d(pred, pred)\nprint(loss.item())  # Output should be 0.0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Normalization**: We normalize `pred` and `target` to ensure they sum to 1 across the spatial dimensions (H, W). This is crucial for them to be valid probability distributions.\n  \n- **KL Divergence Calculation**: We compute the KL divergence using the formula, adding a small constant (`1e-10`) to avoid taking the log of zero.\n\n- **Reduction**: We handle the reduction as specified by the `reduction` argument. If `reduction` is not recognized, we raise a `ValueError`.\n\nThis function should correctly compute the KL divergence loss between two heatmaps, handling different reduction methods as specified.",
