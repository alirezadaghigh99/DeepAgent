    "result": "To generate the Python function for calculating the Average Endpoint Error (AEPE) between two flow maps, we'll break down the task into several steps. We'll use PyTorch for tensor operations, as indicated by the example provided. Here's how we can implement the function:\n\n### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries\nFirst, we need to import PyTorch since the example uses PyTorch tensors.\n\n```python\nimport torch\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the Function Signature\nWe'll define the function `aepe` with the specified arguments: `input`, `target`, and `reduction`.\n\n```python\ndef aepe(input: torch.Tensor, target: torch.Tensor, reduction: str = 'mean') -> torch.Tensor:\n```\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Endpoint Error\nThe endpoint error is calculated as the Euclidean distance between corresponding vectors in the input and target flow maps.\n\n```python\n    # Calculate the squared differences\n    diff = input - target\n    squared_diff = diff ** 2\n    \n    # Sum the squared differences along the last dimension (the 2D vector components)\n    sum_squared_diff = squared_diff.sum(dim=-1)\n    \n    # Take the square root to get the Euclidean distance\n    endpoint_error = torch.sqrt(sum_squared_diff)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Reduction\nDepending on the `reduction` parameter, we will either return the mean, sum, or no reduction of the endpoint error.\n\n```python\n    if reduction == 'mean':\n        return endpoint_error.mean()\n    elif reduction == 'sum':\n        return endpoint_error.sum()\n    elif reduction == 'none':\n        return endpoint_error\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Invalid reduction type: {reduction}. Expected 'none', 'mean', or 'sum'.\")\n```\n\n### Step 5: Complete Function\nCombine all the steps to complete the function.\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef aepe(input: torch.Tensor, target: torch.Tensor, reduction: str = 'mean') -> torch.Tensor:\n    # Calculate the squared differences\n    diff = input - target\n    squared_diff = diff ** 2\n    \n    # Sum the squared differences along the last dimension (the 2D vector components)\n    sum_squared_diff = squared_diff.sum(dim=-1)\n    \n    # Take the square root to get the Euclidean distance\n    endpoint_error = torch.sqrt(sum_squared_diff)\n    \n    # Apply the specified reduction\n    if reduction == 'mean':\n        return endpoint_error.mean()\n    elif reduction == 'sum':\n        return endpoint_error.sum()\n    elif reduction == 'none':\n        return endpoint_error\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Invalid reduction type: {reduction}. Expected 'none', 'mean', or 'sum'.\")\n```\n\n### Example Usage\nYou can use the function as shown in the example:\n\n```python\nones = torch.ones(4, 4, 2)\nresult = aepe(ones, 1.2 * ones)\nprint(result)  # Should output a tensor with the AEPE value\n```\n\nThis function calculates the AEPE between two flow maps and supports different types of reduction as specified.",
