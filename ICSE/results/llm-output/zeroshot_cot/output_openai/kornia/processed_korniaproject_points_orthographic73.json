    "result": "To create the `project_points_orthographic` function, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: Since we're dealing with tensors, we'll use PyTorch.\n2. **Define the Function**: The function will take a tensor as input and return a tensor.\n3. **Implement Orthographic Projection**: For orthographic projection, we simply drop the z-coordinate.\n4. **Return the Result**: The function should return the projected points.\n\nLet's implement this step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries\n\nWe'll use PyTorch for tensor operations.\n\n```python\nimport torch\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the Function\n\nWe'll define the function `project_points_orthographic`.\n\n```python\ndef project_points_orthographic(points_in_camera):\n    \"\"\"\n    Project one or more points from the camera frame into the canonical z=1 plane through orthographic projection.\n\n    Args:\n        points_in_camera: Tensor representing the points to project.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor representing the projected points.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Step 3: Implement Orthographic Projection\n\nFor orthographic projection, we only need the x and y coordinates. We can achieve this by slicing the input tensor.\n\n```python\n    # Ensure the input is a 2D tensor for batch processing\n    if points_in_camera.dim() == 1:\n        points_in_camera = points_in_camera.unsqueeze(0)\n    \n    # Select the x and y coordinates\n    projected_points = points_in_camera[:, :2]\n```\n\n### Step 4: Return the Result\n\nFinally, return the projected points.\n\n```python\n    return projected_points\n```\n\n### Complete Function\n\nHere's the complete function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef project_points_orthographic(points_in_camera):\n    \"\"\"\n    Project one or more points from the camera frame into the canonical z=1 plane through orthographic projection.\n\n    Args:\n        points_in_camera: Tensor representing the points to project.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor representing the projected points.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure the input is a 2D tensor for batch processing\n    if points_in_camera.dim() == 1:\n        points_in_camera = points_in_camera.unsqueeze(0)\n    \n    # Select the x and y coordinates\n    projected_points = points_in_camera[:, :2]\n    \n    return projected_points\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nYou can use the function as follows:\n\n```python\npoints = torch.tensor([1., 2., 3.])\nprojected_points = project_points_orthographic(points)\nprint(projected_points)  # Output: tensor([1., 2.])\n```\n\nThis function will work for both single points and batches of points. If you have a batch of points, ensure that the input tensor is of shape `(N, 3)`, where `N` is the number of points.",
