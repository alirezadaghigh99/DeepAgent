    "result": "To implement the `get_perspective_transform` function using the Direct Linear Transform (DLT) algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set up the system of equations**: For each pair of corresponding points, we derive two equations from the perspective transformation formula. Given four pairs of points, this results in a system of eight equations.\n\n2. **Construct the matrix A**: The system of equations can be represented in matrix form as `Ah = 0`, where `A` is an 8x9 matrix and `h` is the vector of the homography matrix elements.\n\n3. **Solve for h using SVD**: The solution to this system is the right singular vector of `A` corresponding to the smallest singular value, which can be found using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).\n\n4. **Reshape the solution vector into a 3x3 matrix**: The resulting vector `h` is reshaped into the 3x3 homography matrix.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef get_perspective_transform(points_src, points_dst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate a perspective transform from four pairs of the corresponding points using DLT.\n\n    Args:\n        points_src: coordinates of quadrangle vertices in the source image with shape (B, 4, 2).\n        points_dst: coordinates of the corresponding quadrangle vertices in the destination image with shape (B, 4, 2).\n\n    Returns:\n        The perspective transformation with shape (B, 3, 3).\n    \"\"\"\n    assert points_src.shape == points_dst.shape, \"Source and destination points must have the same shape\"\n    assert points_src.shape[1:] == (4, 2), \"Each batch must contain four pairs of points\"\n\n    batch_size = points_src.shape[0]\n    A = torch.zeros((batch_size, 8, 9), dtype=points_src.dtype, device=points_src.device)\n\n    for i in range(4):\n        X, Y = points_src[:, i, 0], points_src[:, i, 1]\n        x, y = points_dst[:, i, 0], points_dst[:, i, 1]\n\n        A[:, 2 * i, 0] = -X\n        A[:, 2 * i, 1] = -Y\n        A[:, 2 * i, 2] = -1\n        A[:, 2 * i, 6] = X * x\n        A[:, 2 * i, 7] = Y * x\n        A[:, 2 * i, 8] = x\n\n        A[:, 2 * i + 1, 3] = -X\n        A[:, 2 * i + 1, 4] = -Y\n        A[:, 2 * i + 1, 5] = -1\n        A[:, 2 * i + 1, 6] = X * y\n        A[:, 2 * i + 1, 7] = Y * y\n        A[:, 2 * i + 1, 8] = y\n\n    # Solve Ah = 0 using SVD\n    _, _, V = torch.svd(A)\n    H = V[:, :, -1].reshape(batch_size, 3, 3)\n\n    return H\n\n# Example usage\nx1 = torch.tensor([[[0., 0.], [1., 0.], [1., 1.], [0., 1.]]])\nx2 = torch.tensor([[[1., 0.], [0., 0.], [0., 1.], [1., 1.]]])\nx2_trans_x1 = get_perspective_transform(x1, x2)\nprint(x2_trans_x1)\n```\n\nThis function computes the perspective transformation matrix for each batch of point pairs using the DLT algorithm.
