    "result": "To implement the `forward` function for the `STEFunction` class, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Store Context**: Save any necessary information in the context (`ctx`) that will be needed for the backward pass. In this case, we need to store the `grad_fn` if it is provided.\n\n2. **Return Output**: The forward function should return the output tensor as it is, since the purpose of the STE is to act as an identity function during the forward pass.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `forward` function:\n\n```python\nfrom torch.autograd import Function\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom typing import Any, Optional, Callable\n\nclass STEFunction(Function):\n    \"\"\"Straight-Through Estimation (STE) function.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def forward(ctx: Any, input: Tensor, output: Tensor, grad_fn: Optional[Callable[..., Any]] = None) -> Tensor:\n        # Store the gradient function in the context for use in backward\n        ctx.grad_fn = grad_fn\n        # Return the output as is, since STE acts as an identity function in forward pass\n        return output\n```\n\nThis implementation stores the `grad_fn` in the context, which can be used later in the backward pass to modify the gradients if needed. The forward function simply returns the `output` tensor, maintaining the identity behavior of the STE during the forward pass.",
    "prompt": "Write the forward function for following class : \nclass STEFunction(Function):\n    \"\"\"Straight-Through Estimation (STE) function.\n\n    STE bridges the gradients between the input tensor and output tensor as if the function\n    was an identity function. Meanwhile, advanced gradient functions are also supported. e.g.\n    the output gradients can be mapped into [-1, 1] with ``F.hardtanh`` function.\n\n    Args:\n        grad_fn: function to restrain the gradient received.
