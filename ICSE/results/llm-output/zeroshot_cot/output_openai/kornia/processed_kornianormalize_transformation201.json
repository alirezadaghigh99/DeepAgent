    "result": "To create the `normalize_transformation` function, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check the Dimensions**: Ensure that the input matrix `M` has at least 2x2 dimensions. If not, raise an `AssertionError`.\n\n2. **Normalize the Matrix**: Adjust the matrix so that the value in the last row and column is set to one. This involves dividing the entire matrix by the value at the last row and column.\n\n3. **Return the Normalized Matrix**: Ensure the output matrix has the same shape as the input.\n\nLet's implement this step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Check the Dimensions\n\nWe need to ensure that the input matrix `M` has at least 2 dimensions. We can use an assertion for this.\n\n### Step 2: Normalize the Matrix\n\nTo normalize the matrix, we divide all elements of the matrix by the element at the last row and last column. We need to handle potential division by zero using the `eps` parameter.\n\n### Step 3: Return the Normalized Matrix\n\nFinally, return the normalized matrix.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef normalize_transformation(M, eps=1e-8):\n    # Step 1: Check the dimensions\n    assert M.ndim >= 2, \"Input matrix M must have at least 2 dimensions\"\n    \n    # Step 2: Normalize the matrix\n    # Get the value at the last row and last column\n    last_value = M[-1, -1]\n    \n    # Avoid division by zero by using eps\n    if abs(last_value) < eps:\n        last_value = eps if last_value >= 0 else -eps\n    \n    # Divide the entire matrix by the last_value\n    normalized_M = M / last_value\n    \n    # Step 3: Return the normalized matrix\n    return normalized_M\n\n# Example usage:\n# M = np.array([[2, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 2]])\n# normalized_M = normalize_transformation(M)\n# print(normalized_M)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Assertion**: We use `assert M.ndim >= 2` to ensure the matrix has at least 2 dimensions.\n- **Normalization**: We divide the entire matrix by the value at the last row and column. We use `eps` to avoid division by zero.\n- **Return**: The function returns the normalized matrix with the same shape as the input.\n\nThis function should work for any transformation matrix with at least 2x2 dimensions.",
    "prompt": "---\n\nCreate a Python function `normalize_transformation` that:\n\n- Accepts two parameters:\n  - `M`: A tensor representing a transformation matrix of any shape with at least 2x2 dimensions.\n  - `eps`: A small float value (default is `1e-8`) used to avoid numerical instabilities during backpropagation.\n- The function normalizes the input transformation matrix `M` so that the value in the last row and column is set to one.\n- Returns the normalized transformation matrix with the same shape as the input.\n\nErrors:\n- Raises an `AssertionError` if the input matrix `M` has fewer than 2 dimensions.",
