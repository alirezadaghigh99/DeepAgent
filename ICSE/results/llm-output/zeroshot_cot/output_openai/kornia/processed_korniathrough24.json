    "result": "To create the `through` method within the `ParametrizedLine` class, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Class Structure**: We'll start by defining the `ParametrizedLine` class with an initializer to store the origin and direction of the line.\n\n2. **Implement the `through` Method**: This method will take two tensors, `p0` and `p1`, and compute the direction vector from `p0` to `p1`. It will then normalize this direction vector.\n\n3. **Return an Instance**: The method will return an instance of `ParametrizedLine` initialized with `p0` as the origin and the normalized direction vector.\n\nLet's implement this step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Class Structure\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\nclass ParametrizedLine:\n    def __init__(self, origin, direction):\n        self.origin = origin\n        self.direction = direction\n```\n\n### Step 2: Implement the `through` Method\n\n```python\n    @staticmethod\n    def through(p0, p1):\n        # Calculate the direction vector from p0 to p1\n        direction = p1 - p0\n        \n        # Normalize the direction vector\n        norm = torch.norm(direction, dim=1, keepdim=True)\n        normalized_direction = direction / norm\n        \n        # Return an instance of ParametrizedLine\n        return ParametrizedLine(origin=p0, direction=normalized_direction)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Complete the Class\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\nclass ParametrizedLine:\n    def __init__(self, origin, direction):\n        self.origin = origin\n        self.direction = direction\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def through(p0, p1):\n        # Calculate the direction vector from p0 to p1\n        direction = p1 - p0\n        \n        # Normalize the direction vector\n        norm = torch.norm(direction, dim=1, keepdim=True)\n        normalized_direction = direction / norm\n        \n        # Return an instance of ParametrizedLine\n        return ParametrizedLine(origin=p0, direction=normalized_direction)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Origin**: The `origin` of the line is set to `p0`.\n- **Direction**: The `direction` is calculated as `p1 - p0` and then normalized. Normalization is done by dividing the direction vector by its norm, ensuring the direction vector has a unit length.\n- **Static Method**: The `through` method is a static method because it doesn't depend on an instance of `ParametrizedLine` to be called. It constructs a new instance based on the input points.\n\nThis implementation allows you to create a parameterized line between two points, which is useful in various applications like computer graphics and physics simulations.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python method `through` within the `ParametrizedLine` class that constructs a parametrized line between two points, `p0` and `p1`. Both `p0` and `p1` are tensors of shape `(B, D)`, where `B` is the batch size and `D` is the dimensionality of the points. The method should return an instance of `ParametrizedLine` by calculating the direction vector from `p0` to `p1` and normalizing it. This method is useful in geometry-related tasks, such as computer graphics or physics simulations, where representing and working with lines in a parameterized form is necessary.",
