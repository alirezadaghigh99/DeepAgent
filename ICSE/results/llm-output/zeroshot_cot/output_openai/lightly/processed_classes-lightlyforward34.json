    "result": "To implement the `forward` method for the `SwaVLoss` class, we need to compute the SwaV loss using the high-resolution and low-resolution outputs. The SwaV loss involves comparing the outputs of different views and optionally using a queue to enhance the representation learning. Here's how we can implement this step by step:\n\n1. **Initialize the Loss**: Start by initializing a variable to accumulate the total loss.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Views**: Loop over each view in the high-resolution and low-resolution outputs. For each view, compute the subloss using the `subloss` method.\n\n3. **Handle Queue Outputs**: If queue outputs are provided, incorporate them into the loss calculation. This typically involves comparing the current outputs with the queue outputs.\n\n4. **Average the Sublosses**: After computing the subloss for each view, average them to get the final loss.\n\n5. **Return the Final Loss**: Return the averaged loss as a `torch.Tensor`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `forward` method:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass SwaVLoss(nn.Module):\n    def subloss(self, z: torch.Tensor, q: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        # Example implementation of subloss using cross-entropy\n        return nn.functional.cross_entropy(z, q)\n\n    def forward(self, high_resolution_outputs: List[torch.Tensor], low_resolution_outputs: List[torch.Tensor], queue_outputs: List[torch.Tensor] = None) -> torch.Tensor:\n        total_loss = 0.0\n        num_views = len(high_resolution_outputs)\n\n        # Iterate over each view\n        for i in range(num_views):\n            # Compute subloss for high-resolution outputs\n            z_high = high_resolution_outputs[i]\n            q_high = low_resolution_outputs[i]  # Assuming q is derived from low-res outputs\n            loss_high = self.subloss(z_high, q_high)\n            total_loss += loss_high\n\n            # If queue outputs are provided, compute subloss with them\n            if queue_outputs is not None:\n                z_queue = queue_outputs[i]\n                loss_queue = self.subloss(z_high, z_queue)\n                total_loss += loss_queue\n\n        # Average the total loss over the number of views\n        final_loss = total_loss / num_views\n        return final_loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **subloss Method**: This method computes the cross-entropy loss between predictions `z` and codes `q`. You can customize this method based on your specific requirements.\n\n- **Iterating Over Views**: We loop through each view in the high-resolution outputs. For each view, we compute the subloss between the high-resolution output and the corresponding low-resolution output.\n\n- **Queue Handling**: If queue outputs are provided, we compute an additional subloss between the high-resolution output and the queue output.\n\n- **Averaging**: The total loss is averaged over the number of views to get the final loss.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the `subloss` method is correctly defined to compute the desired loss between the outputs. Adjust the `subloss` method as needed for your specific use case.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function `forward` for the class `SwaVLoss` that computes the SwaV loss using high-resolution and low-resolution outputs. The function should handle optional queue outputs and calculate the final loss by averaging sublosses across different views. The function should return the SwaV loss as a `torch.Tensor`. Here is the class structure:\n\n```python\nclass SwaVLoss(nn.Module):\n    def subloss(self, z: torch.Tensor, q: torch.Tensor):\n        # Returns the cross entropy between predictions z and codes q as a tensor.\n    def forward(self, high_resolution_outputs: List[torch.Tensor], low_resolution_outputs: List[torch.Tensor], queue_outputs: List[torch.Tensor] = None) -> torch.Tensor:\n```",
