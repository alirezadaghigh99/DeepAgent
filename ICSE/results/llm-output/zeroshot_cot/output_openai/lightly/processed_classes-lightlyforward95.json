    "result": "To implement the `forward` function for the `MMCRLoss` class, we will follow the steps outlined in your request. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Ensure the `online` and `momentum` tensors have the same shape.** We can use an assertion to check this.\n\n2. **Concatenate `online` and `momentum` along the second dimension.** We will use `torch.cat` for this operation.\n\n3. **Compute the centroid of the concatenated tensor.** The centroid can be computed as the mean of the concatenated tensor along the batch dimension (usually the first dimension).\n\n4. **Calculate the singular values of the concatenated tensor and the centroid.** We will use `torch.svd` to compute the singular values.\n\n5. **Compute the loss.** The loss is calculated as the negative sum of the singular values of the centroid plus the weighted sum of the singular values of the concatenated tensor, divided by the batch size.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass MMCRLoss(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, lmda: float = 5e-3):\n        super().__init__()\n        if lmda < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"lmda must be greater than or equal to 0\")\n\n        self.lmda = lmda\n\n    def forward(self, online: torch.Tensor, momentum: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        # Ensure the online and momentum tensors have the same shape\n        assert online.shape == momentum.shape, \"online and momentum must have the same shape\"\n\n        # Concatenate online and momentum along the second dimension\n        concatenated = torch.cat((online, momentum), dim=1)\n\n        # Compute the centroid of the concatenated tensor\n        centroid = concatenated.mean(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n        # Calculate the singular values of the concatenated tensor\n        _, singular_values_concat, _ = torch.svd(concatenated)\n\n        # Calculate the singular values of the centroid\n        _, singular_values_centroid, _ = torch.svd(centroid)\n\n        # Compute the loss\n        batch_size = online.size(0)\n        loss = -singular_values_centroid.sum() + self.lmda * singular_values_concat.sum()\n        loss = loss / batch_size\n\n        return loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Assertion:** We use `assert online.shape == momentum.shape` to ensure both tensors have the same shape.\n- **Concatenation:** `torch.cat((online, momentum), dim=1)` concatenates the tensors along the second dimension.\n- **Centroid Calculation:** `concatenated.mean(dim=0, keepdim=True)` computes the mean along the batch dimension to get the centroid.\n- **Singular Value Decomposition:** `torch.svd` is used to compute the singular values of both the concatenated tensor and the centroid.\n- **Loss Calculation:** The loss is computed as specified, using the negative sum of the singular values of the centroid and the weighted sum of the singular values of the concatenated tensor, divided by the batch size.",
