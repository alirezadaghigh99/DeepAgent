    "result": "To complete the `block_diag_embed` function, we need to create a block diagonal matrix from a given tensor. The input tensor has a shape of `(..., B, M, N)`, and we want to return a tensor of shape `(..., B * M, B * N)`, where each `M x N` block from the input tensor is placed along the diagonal of the output tensor.\n\nHere's how we can achieve this step by step:\n\n1. **Extract the shape information**: We need to know the dimensions of the input tensor to manipulate it correctly.\n\n2. **Create an output tensor**: Initialize a tensor of zeros with the desired output shape.\n\n3. **Fill the diagonal blocks**: Iterate over the batch dimension `B` and place each `M x N` block from the input tensor into the correct position in the output tensor.\n\nHere's the complete code for the function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef block_diag_embed(mat):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a tensor of shape (..., B, M, N) and returns a block diagonal tensor\n    of shape (..., B x M, B x N).\n\n    :param torch.Tensor mat: an input tensor with 3 or more dimensions\n    :returns torch.Tensor: a block diagonal tensor with dimension `m.dim() - 1`\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the shape of the input tensor\n    *batch_dims, B, M, N = mat.shape\n    \n    # Calculate the shape of the output tensor\n    output_shape = (*batch_dims, B * M, B * N)\n    \n    # Initialize the output tensor with zeros\n    result = torch.zeros(output_shape, dtype=mat.dtype, device=mat.device)\n    \n    # Fill the diagonal blocks\n    for i in range(B):\n        # Calculate the start and end indices for the current block\n        start_row = i * M\n        end_row = start_row + M\n        start_col = i * N\n        end_col = start_col + N\n        \n        # Place the current block in the result tensor\n        result[..., start_row:end_row, start_col:end_col] = mat[..., i, :, :]\n    \n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Shape Extraction**: We use Python's unpacking to extract the batch dimensions and the dimensions `B`, `M`, and `N` from the input tensor's shape.\n\n- **Output Tensor Initialization**: We create a tensor of zeros with the desired output shape, ensuring it has the same data type and device as the input tensor.\n\n- **Block Placement**: We loop over each block index `i` in the batch dimension `B`. For each block, we calculate the starting and ending indices for both rows and columns in the output tensor. We then assign the corresponding block from the input tensor to the calculated position in the output tensor.\n\nThis function will efficiently create a block diagonal tensor from the input tensor.",
