    "result": "To create the `extract_tensors` function, we need to iterate through an input that could either be a single PennyLane tensor or a sequence of such tensors. The function should yield each tensor it encounters. Let's break down the steps to implement this:\n\n### Step 1: Import Necessary Modules\n\nFirst, we need to import the necessary modules. Since we're dealing with PennyLane tensors, we should import PennyLane. However, for this example, I'll assume that the PennyLane library is already installed and available.\n\n```python\nimport pennylane as qml\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the Function\n\nWe'll define the function `extract_tensors` with the specified argument `x`.\n\n```python\ndef extract_tensors(x):\n```\n\n### Step 3: Check if the Input is a Single Tensor\n\nWe need to determine if the input `x` is a single PennyLane tensor. If it is, we yield it directly.\n\n```python\n    if isinstance(x, qml.numpy.tensor):\n        yield x\n```\n\n### Step 4: Handle Sequences\n\nIf `x` is not a single tensor, we assume it is a sequence. We need to iterate through the sequence and yield each tensor.\n\n```python\n    elif isinstance(x, (list, tuple)):\n        for item in x:\n            if isinstance(item, qml.numpy.tensor):\n                yield item\n```\n\n### Step 5: Handle Nested Sequences\n\nTo handle nested sequences, we can use recursion. If an item in the sequence is itself a sequence, we call `extract_tensors` recursively.\n\n```python\n            elif isinstance(item, (list, tuple)):\n                yield from extract_tensors(item)\n```\n\n### Step 6: Complete the Function\n\nHere's the complete function with all the steps combined:\n\n```python\nimport pennylane as qml\n\ndef extract_tensors(x):\n    \"\"\"Iterate through an iterable, and extract any PennyLane tensors that appear.\n\n    Args:\n        x (.tensor or Sequence): an input tensor or sequence\n\n    Yields:\n        tensor: the next tensor in the sequence. If the input was a single\n        tensor, then the tensor is yielded and the iterator completes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(x, qml.numpy.tensor):\n        yield x\n    elif isinstance(x, (list, tuple)):\n        for item in x:\n            if isinstance(item, qml.numpy.tensor):\n                yield item\n            elif isinstance(item, (list, tuple)):\n                yield from extract_tensors(item)\n```\n\nThis function will iterate through the input `x`, yielding each PennyLane tensor it finds, whether `x` is a single tensor, a sequence, or a nested sequence.",
