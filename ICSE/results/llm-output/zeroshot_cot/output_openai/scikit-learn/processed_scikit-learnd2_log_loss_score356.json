    "result": "To create the `d2_log_loss_score` function, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: We'll need NumPy for numerical operations and scikit-learn for calculating log loss and handling label binarization.\n\n2. **Define the Function**: The function will take `y_true`, `y_pred`, `sample_weight`, and `labels` as parameters.\n\n3. **Handle Edge Cases**: Check if the number of samples is less than two and return NaN if true.\n\n4. **Infer Labels**: If labels are not provided, infer them from `y_true`.\n\n5. **Calculate Log Loss**: Compute the log loss for the predictions and the baseline (mean prediction).\n\n6. **Calculate D^2 Score**: Use the formula for D^2 score, which is the fraction of log loss explained.\n\n7. **Return the Result**: Return the calculated D^2 score.\n\nHere's the complete code for the function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics import log_loss\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelBinarizer\nfrom sklearn.utils import check_array, check_consistent_length\nfrom sklearn.utils.multiclass import unique_labels\nimport warnings\nfrom sklearn.exceptions import UndefinedMetricWarning\n\ndef d2_log_loss_score(y_true, y_pred, sample_weight=None, labels=None):\n    # Check if the number of samples is less than two\n    if len(y_pred) < 2:\n        msg = \"D^2 score is not well-defined with less than two samples.\"\n        warnings.warn(msg, UndefinedMetricWarning)\n        return float(\"nan\")\n    \n    # Ensure y_true and y_pred are arrays\n    y_true = check_array(y_true, ensure_2d=False)\n    y_pred = check_array(y_pred, ensure_2d=False)\n    \n    # Check consistent length\n    check_consistent_length(y_true, y_pred, sample_weight)\n    \n    # Infer labels if not provided\n    if labels is None:\n        labels = unique_labels(y_true)\n    \n    # Binarize y_true\n    lb = LabelBinarizer()\n    lb.fit(labels)\n    y_true_binarized = lb.transform(y_true)\n    \n    # Calculate log loss for the predictions\n    log_loss_pred = log_loss(y_true_binarized, y_pred, sample_weight=sample_weight, labels=labels)\n    \n    # Calculate the baseline log loss (mean prediction)\n    y_pred_mean = np.full_like(y_pred, y_true_binarized.mean(axis=0))\n    log_loss_baseline = log_loss(y_true_binarized, y_pred_mean, sample_weight=sample_weight, labels=labels)\n    \n    # Calculate D^2 score\n    d2_score = 1 - (log_loss_pred / log_loss_baseline)\n    \n    return d2_score\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Log Loss Calculation**: We calculate the log loss for both the predicted probabilities and a baseline model that predicts the mean class probabilities.\n\n- **D^2 Score Calculation**: The D^2 score is calculated as `1 - (log_loss_pred / log_loss_baseline)`, which represents the fraction of log loss explained by the model compared to the baseline.\n\n- **Edge Case Handling**: If there are fewer than two samples, the function returns NaN and issues a warning.\n\nThis function should work for both binary and multiclass classification problems, provided the inputs are correctly formatted.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called d2_log_loss_score that calculates the D^2 score, which is the fraction of log loss explained. The function takes in the following parameters:\n\n- y_true: array-like or label indicator matrix, representing the actual labels for the samples.\n- y_pred: array-like of shape (n_samples, n_classes) or (n_samples,), representing the predicted probabilities from a classifier.\n- sample_weight: array-like of shape (n_samples,), representing sample weights.\n- labels: array-like, representing the labels. If not provided, they will be inferred from y_true.\n\nThe function returns the D^2 score as a float or ndarray of floats. It may be negative and is not well-defined for a single sample. The best possible score is 1.0, and a model that always predicts the per-class proportions of y_true gets a score of 0.0. The function also handles cases where the number of samples is less than two, returning a NaN value in such cases.if _num_samples(y_pred) < 2:\n        msg = \"D^2 score is not well-defined with less than two samples.\"\n        warnings.warn(msg, UndefinedMetricWarning)\n        return float(\"nan\")",
