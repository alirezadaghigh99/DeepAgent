    "result": "To generate the `cluster_qr` function step by step, we'll break down the process into manageable parts. The goal is to find the discrete partition closest to the eigenvector embedding using the QR decomposition method. This is often used in spectral clustering to convert continuous embeddings into discrete cluster labels.\n\n### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries\n\nFirst, we need to import the necessary libraries. We'll use NumPy for numerical operations and SciPy for the QR decomposition.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import qr\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the Function Signature\n\nNext, we'll define the function signature for `cluster_qr`. The function will take an array-like object `vectors` as input and return an array of integers `labels`.\n\n```python\ndef cluster_qr(vectors):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the discrete partition closest to the eigenvector embedding.\n\n    Parameters:\n    vectors (array-like): An array with shape (n_samples, n_clusters) representing the embedding space.\n\n    Returns:\n    labels (np.ndarray): An array of integers with shape (n_samples,) representing the cluster labels.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Step 3: Perform QR Decomposition\n\nWe'll perform QR decomposition on the input `vectors`. The QR decomposition will help us orthogonalize the vectors, which is a crucial step in finding the closest discrete partition.\n\n```python\n    # Perform QR decomposition\n    q, _ = qr(vectors)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Assign Cluster Labels\n\nAfter obtaining the orthogonal matrix `q`, we need to assign cluster labels. This can be done by finding the index of the maximum value in each row of `q`, which corresponds to the closest discrete partition.\n\n```python\n    # Assign cluster labels based on the maximum value in each row\n    labels = np.argmax(q, axis=1)\n```\n\n### Step 5: Return the Labels\n\nFinally, we'll return the computed `labels`.\n\n```python\n    return labels\n```\n\n### Complete Function\n\nPutting it all together, here is the complete `cluster_qr` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import qr\n\ndef cluster_qr(vectors):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the discrete partition closest to the eigenvector embedding.\n\n    Parameters:\n    vectors (array-like): An array with shape (n_samples, n_clusters) representing the embedding space.\n\n    Returns:\n    labels (np.ndarray): An array of integers with shape (n_samples,) representing the cluster labels.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Perform QR decomposition\n    q, _ = qr(vectors)\n    \n    # Assign cluster labels based on the maximum value in each row\n    labels = np.argmax(q, axis=1)\n    \n    return labels\n```\n\nThis function should work for finding the discrete partition closest to the eigenvector embedding using the QR decomposition method. Make sure to test it with appropriate data to ensure it behaves as expected.",
