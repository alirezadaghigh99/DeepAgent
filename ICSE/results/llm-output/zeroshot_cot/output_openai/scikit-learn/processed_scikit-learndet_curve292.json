    "result": "To create the `det_curve` function, we need to compute the false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR) for different probability thresholds in a binary classification task. Here's how we can implement this step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries\n\nWe'll need NumPy for numerical operations and potentially some functions from scikit-learn to help with the calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.utils import check_consistent_length\nfrom sklearn.utils import column_or_1d\nfrom sklearn.utils import assert_all_finite\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the `det_curve` Function\n\nWe'll start by defining the function and its parameters.\n\n```python\ndef det_curve(y_true, y_score, pos_label=None, sample_weight=None):\n    # Ensure inputs are consistent\n    y_true = column_or_1d(y_true)\n    y_score = column_or_1d(y_score)\n    check_consistent_length(y_true, y_score, sample_weight)\n    \n    # Ensure all values are finite\n    assert_all_finite(y_true)\n    assert_all_finite(y_score)\n    \n    # Determine the positive label\n    if pos_label is None:\n        pos_label = 1\n    y_true = (y_true == pos_label)\n    \n    # Sort scores and corresponding truth values\n    desc_score_indices = np.argsort(y_score, kind=\"mergesort\")[::-1]\n    y_score = y_score[desc_score_indices]\n    y_true = y_true[desc_score_indices]\n    \n    if sample_weight is not None:\n        sample_weight = np.array(sample_weight)[desc_score_indices]\n    else:\n        sample_weight = np.ones_like(y_true, dtype=float)\n    \n    # Calculate true positives and false positives\n    distinct_value_indices = np.where(np.diff(y_score))[0]\n    threshold_idxs = np.r_[distinct_value_indices, y_true.size - 1]\n    \n    tps = np.cumsum(y_true * sample_weight)[threshold_idxs]\n    fps = np.cumsum((~y_true) * sample_weight)[threshold_idxs]\n    \n    # Calculate false negatives and true negatives\n    fns = tps[-1] - tps\n    tns = fps[-1] - fps\n    \n    # Calculate false positive rate and false negative rate\n    fpr = fps / (fps + tns)\n    fnr = fns / (fns + tps)\n    \n    # Get thresholds\n    thresholds = y_score[threshold_idxs]\n    \n    return fpr, fnr, thresholds\n```\n\n### Step 3: Explanation and Usage\n\n- **Inputs**:\n  - `y_true`: True binary labels.\n  - `y_score`: Target scores (e.g., probabilities or decision function values).\n  - `pos_label`: The label of the positive class.\n  - `sample_weight`: Weights for each sample.\n\n- **Outputs**:\n  - `fpr`: False positive rate for each threshold.\n  - `fnr`: False negative rate for each threshold.\n  - `thresholds`: The score thresholds.\n\n### Step 4: Example Usage\n\nHere's how you might use the `det_curve` function with some sample data:\n\n```python\n# Example usage\ny_true = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])\ny_scores = np.array([0.1, 0.4, 0.35, 0.8])\npos_label = 1\n\nfpr, fnr, thresholds = det_curve(y_true, y_scores, pos_label)\n\nprint(\"False Positive Rates:\", fpr)\nprint(\"False Negative Rates:\", fnr)\nprint(\"Thresholds:\", thresholds)\n```\n\nThis function will help you evaluate the trade-offs between false positives and false negatives at different thresholds, which is crucial for many binary classification tasks.",
