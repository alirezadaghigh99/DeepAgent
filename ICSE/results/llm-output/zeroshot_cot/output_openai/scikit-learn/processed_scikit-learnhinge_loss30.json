    "result": "To create the `hinge_loss` function, we'll break down the implementation into several steps. We'll start by importing necessary libraries and setting up the function signature. Then, we'll handle the binary classification case, followed by the multiclass classification case. Finally, we'll incorporate error handling and sample weighting. Let's go through these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Import Libraries and Define Function Signature\n\nFirst, we need to import NumPy for efficient numerical operations and define the function signature.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef hinge_loss(y_true, pred_decision, labels=None, sample_weight=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average hinge loss for binary or multiclass classification tasks.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - y_true: array-like, shape (n_samples,)\n        True target values, encoded as integers (+1 and -1 for binary classification).\n    - pred_decision: array-like, shape (n_samples, n_classes) or (n_samples,)\n        Predicted decision values.\n    - labels: array-like, shape (n_classes,), optional\n        All the labels for multiclass hinge loss.\n    - sample_weight: array-like, shape (n_samples,), optional\n        Sample weights.\n\n    Returns:\n    - float\n        The average hinge loss.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Step 2: Handle Binary Classification\n\nFor binary classification, the hinge loss is calculated as `max(0, 1 - y_true * pred_decision)`.\n\n```python\n    y_true = np.asarray(y_true)\n    pred_decision = np.asarray(pred_decision)\n\n    if labels is None:\n        labels = np.unique(y_true)\n\n    if len(labels) == 2:\n        # Binary classification\n        if set(labels) != {-1, 1}:\n            raise ValueError(\"For binary classification, labels must be encoded as -1 and 1.\")\n        \n        loss = np.maximum(0, 1 - y_true * pred_decision)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Handle Multiclass Classification\n\nFor multiclass classification, we calculate the hinge loss using the formula `max(0, 1 - (y_true_score - max_other_scores))`.\n\n```python\n    else:\n        # Multiclass classification\n        if labels is None:\n            labels = np.unique(y_true)\n        \n        n_samples = y_true.shape[0]\n        n_classes = len(labels)\n        \n        if pred_decision.shape[1] != n_classes:\n            raise ValueError(\"The shape of pred_decision does not match the number of classes.\")\n        \n        correct_class_scores = pred_decision[np.arange(n_samples), y_true]\n        max_other_scores = np.max(pred_decision + (np.arange(n_classes) == y_true[:, None]) * -np.inf, axis=1)\n        \n        loss = np.maximum(0, 1 - (correct_class_scores - max_other_scores))\n```\n\n### Step 4: Apply Sample Weights and Calculate Average Loss\n\nFinally, we apply sample weights if provided and calculate the average hinge loss.\n\n```python\n    if sample_weight is not None:\n        sample_weight = np.asarray(sample_weight)\n        if sample_weight.shape[0] != y_true.shape[0]:\n            raise ValueError(\"sample_weight must have the same length as y_true.\")\n        loss = loss * sample_weight\n\n    return np.mean(loss)\n```\n\n### Complete Function\n\nHere's the complete `hinge_loss` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef hinge_loss(y_true, pred_decision, labels=None, sample_weight=None):\n    y_true = np.asarray(y_true)\n    pred_decision = np.asarray(pred_decision)\n\n    if labels is None:\n        labels = np.unique(y_true)\n\n    if len(labels) == 2:\n        # Binary classification\n        if set(labels) != {-1, 1}:\n            raise ValueError(\"For binary classification, labels must be encoded as -1 and 1.\")\n        \n        loss = np.maximum(0, 1 - y_true * pred_decision)\n    else:\n        # Multiclass classification\n        if labels is None:\n            labels = np.unique(y_true)\n        \n        n_samples = y_true.shape[0]\n        n_classes = len(labels)\n        \n        if pred_decision.shape[1] != n_classes:\n            raise ValueError(\"The shape of pred_decision does not match the number of classes.\")\n        \n        correct_class_scores = pred_decision[np.arange(n_samples), y_true]\n        max_other_scores = np.max(pred_decision + (np.arange(n_classes) == y_true[:, None]) * -np.inf, axis=1)\n        \n        loss = np.maximum(0, 1 - (correct_class_scores - max_other_scores))\n\n    if sample_weight is not None:\n        sample_weight = np.asarray(sample_weight)\n        if sample_weight.shape[0] != y_true.shape[0]:\n            raise ValueError(\"sample_weight must have the same length as y_true.\")\n        loss = loss * sample_weight\n\n    return np.mean(loss)\n```\n\nThis function should now correctly compute the average hinge loss for both binary and multiclass classification tasks, with support for sample weighting and error handling.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called hinge_loss that calculates the average hinge loss for binary or multiclass classification tasks. The function takes in the following parameters:\n\n- y_true: an array-like object containing the true target values, encoded as integers (+1 and -1 for binary classification).\n- pred_decision: an array-like object containing the predicted decision values.\n- labels: an optional array-like object containing all the labels for multiclass hinge loss.\n- sample_weight: an optional array-like object containing sample weights.\n\nThe function returns the average hinge loss as a float value. The hinge loss is calculated based on the margin between the true and predicted values, and it serves as an upper bound for the number of classification mistakes made by the classifier.\n\nThe function handles both binary and multiclass cases, applying different calculations based on the number of unique labels present in the target values. The implementation includes error handling for different scenarios and utilizes NumPy functions for efficient computation.",
