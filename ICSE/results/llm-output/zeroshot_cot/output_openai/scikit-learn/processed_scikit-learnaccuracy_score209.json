    "result": "Sure, let's build the `accuracy_score` function step by step. We'll start by defining the function and its parameters, and then implement the logic to calculate the accuracy score.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\nFirst, we'll define the function with the specified parameters: `y_true`, `y_pred`, `normalize`, and `sample_weight`.\n\n```python\ndef accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred, normalize=True, sample_weight=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the accuracy classification score.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - y_true: list or array-like of shape (n_samples,) - Ground truth (correct) labels.\n    - y_pred: list or array-like of shape (n_samples,) - Predicted labels.\n    - normalize: bool, default=True - If True, return the fraction of correctly classified samples.\n      Otherwise, return the number of correctly classified samples.\n    - sample_weight: list or array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None - Sample weights.\n\n    Returns:\n    - float or int: Accuracy score.\n    \"\"\"\n    pass  # Placeholder for the implementation\n```\n\n### Step 2: Implement the Logic\n\nNext, we'll implement the logic to calculate the accuracy score. We'll compare `y_true` and `y_pred` to count the number of correctly classified samples. If `sample_weight` is provided, we'll use it to weight the samples.\n\n```python\ndef accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred, normalize=True, sample_weight=None):\n    correct = 0\n    total_weight = 0\n\n    if sample_weight is None:\n        sample_weight = [1] * len(y_true)\n\n    for true, pred, weight in zip(y_true, y_pred, sample_weight):\n        if true == pred:\n            correct += weight\n        total_weight += weight\n\n    if normalize:\n        return correct / total_weight\n    else:\n        return correct\n```\n\n### Step 3: Add Examples\n\nFinally, let's add some examples to demonstrate how to use the function.\n\n```python\ndef accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred, normalize=True, sample_weight=None):\n    correct = 0\n    total_weight = 0\n\n    if sample_weight is None:\n        sample_weight = [1] * len(y_true)\n\n    for true, pred, weight in zip(y_true, y_pred, sample_weight):\n        if true == pred:\n            correct += weight\n        total_weight += weight\n\n    if normalize:\n        return correct / total_weight\n    else:\n        return correct\n\n# Examples\ny_true = [0, 1, 2, 3]\ny_pred = [0, 2, 2, 3]\n\n# Example 1: Without sample weights, normalized\nprint(accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred))  # Output: 0.75\n\n# Example 2: Without sample weights, not normalized\nprint(accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred, normalize=False))  # Output: 3\n\n# Example 3: With sample weights, normalized\nsample_weight = [0.5, 1, 1, 1.5]\nprint(accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred, sample_weight=sample_weight))  # Output: 0.7\n\n# Example 4: With sample weights, not normalized\nprint(accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred, normalize=False, sample_weight=sample_weight))  # Output: 2.8\n```\n\nThis function calculates the accuracy score based on the given parameters and handles both weighted and unweighted cases. The examples demonstrate how to use the function with different configurations.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called accuracy_score that calculates the accuracy classification score. The function takes in the following parameters:\n\n- y_true: Ground truth (correct) labels\n- y_pred: Predicted labels\n- normalize: Boolean value indicating whether to return the fraction of correctly classified samples or the number of correctly classified samples\n- sample_weight: Sample weights\n\nThe function returns a float or integer value based on the normalize parameter. The best performance is 1 when normalize is True and the number of samples when normalize is False.\n\nThe function also includes examples demonstrating how to use it with different inputs.",
