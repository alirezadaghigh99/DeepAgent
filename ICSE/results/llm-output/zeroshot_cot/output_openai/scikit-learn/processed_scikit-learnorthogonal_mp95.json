    "result": "To implement the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm in Python, we'll break down the process into several steps. We'll start by setting up the function signature and then proceed to implement the core logic of the OMP algorithm. Finally, we'll add options for returning additional information like the coefficient path and the number of iterations.\n\n### Step 1: Function Signature\n\nFirst, let's define the function signature with the necessary parameters and default values for the optional parameters.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef orthogonal_mp(X, y, n_nonzero_coefs=None, tol=None, precompute=False, copy_X=True, return_path=False, return_n_iter=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - X: array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)\n    - y: ndarray of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_targets)\n    - n_nonzero_coefs: int, optional\n    - tol: float, optional\n    - precompute: bool, optional\n    - copy_X: bool, optional\n    - return_path: bool, optional\n    - return_n_iter: bool, optional\n\n    Returns:\n    - coef: ndarray of shape (n_features,) or (n_features, n_targets)\n    - n_iters: int, optional\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure y is a 2D array for consistency\n    if y.ndim == 1:\n        y = y[:, np.newaxis]\n\n    n_samples, n_features = X.shape\n    n_targets = y.shape[1]\n\n    # Initialize coefficients and residuals\n    coef = np.zeros((n_features, n_targets))\n    residuals = y.copy()\n\n    # Additional variables for tracking\n    if return_path:\n        coef_path = []\n\n    # Main loop for OMP\n    for target in range(n_targets):\n        active_set = []\n        current_residual = residuals[:, target]\n        current_coef = np.zeros(n_features)\n\n        for _ in range(n_nonzero_coefs or n_features):\n            # Step 1: Find the best matching feature\n            correlations = X.T @ current_residual\n            best_feature = np.argmax(np.abs(correlations))\n\n            # Step 2: Update active set\n            if best_feature not in active_set:\n                active_set.append(best_feature)\n\n            # Step 3: Solve least squares problem\n            X_active = X[:, active_set]\n            coef_active, _, _, _ = np.linalg.lstsq(X_active, y[:, target], rcond=None)\n\n            # Step 4: Update coefficients and residuals\n            current_coef[active_set] = coef_active\n            current_residual = y[:, target] - X_active @ coef_active\n\n            # Check stopping criteria\n            if tol is not None and np.sum(current_residual**2) <= tol:\n                break\n\n            if return_path:\n                coef_path.append(current_coef.copy())\n\n        coef[:, target] = current_coef\n\n    if return_n_iter:\n        return coef, len(active_set)\n    if return_path:\n        return coef, coef_path\n    return coef\n```\n\n### Step 2: Explanation and Usage\n\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `X`: The input data matrix.\n  - `y`: The target values.\n  - `n_nonzero_coefs`: The maximum number of non-zero coefficients.\n  - `tol`: The tolerance for the stopping criterion based on the residual norm.\n  - `precompute`: Not used in this basic implementation but can be used for optimization.\n  - `copy_X`: Whether to copy the input matrix `X`.\n  - `return_path`: Whether to return the path of coefficients.\n  - `return_n_iter`: Whether to return the number of iterations.\n\n- **Returns**:\n  - `coef`: The coefficients of the OMP solution.\n  - `n_iters`: The number of iterations (if `return_n_iter` is `True`).\n  - `coef_path`: The path of coefficients (if `return_path` is `True`).\n\n### Step 3: Example Usage\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `orthogonal_mp` function:\n\n```python\n# Example usage\nX = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])\ny = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n\n# Solve OMP problem\ncoef = orthogonal_mp(X, y, n_nonzero_coefs=2, tol=1e-6)\n\nprint(\"Coefficients:\", coef)\n```\n\nThis code provides a basic implementation of the OMP algorithm. You can further optimize it by adding precomputation steps or other enhancements as needed.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called orthogonal_mp that implements the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm. The function takes in input parameters X (array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)) and y (ndarray of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_targets)), along with optional parameters such as n_nonzero_coefs, tol, precompute, copy_X, return_path, and return_n_iter. \n\nThe function solves n_targets OMP problems by finding the coefficients of the OMP solution based on the input data X and targets y. The OMP problem is defined as finding the coefficients that minimize the residual error subject to constraints on the number of non-zero coefficients or the maximum squared norm of the residual.\n\nThe function returns the coefficients (coef) of the OMP solution as an ndarray of shape (n_features,) or (n_features, n_targets), along with the number of active features across every target (n_iters) if return_n_iter is set to True. Additionally, the function provides options to return the coefficient path and the number of iterations.\n\nThe OMP algorithm is based on the work by Mallat and Zhang in 1993 and Rubinstein, Zibulevsky, and Elad in 2008. The function includes examples demonstrating the usage of orthogonal_mp with sample data.",
