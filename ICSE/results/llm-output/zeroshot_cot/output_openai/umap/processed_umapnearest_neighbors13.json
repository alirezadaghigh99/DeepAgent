    "result": "To create the `nearest_neighbors` function, we'll break down the task into several steps. We'll use the `scikit-learn` library for nearest neighbor computations, which provides a flexible and efficient implementation. Here's how we can structure the function:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: We'll need `numpy` for array manipulations and `NearestNeighbors` from `scikit-learn` for the nearest neighbor search.\n\n2. **Define the Function Signature**: The function will take several parameters as described.\n\n3. **Handle Random Projection Trees**: If the user opts to use angular random projection trees, we'll need to set up this approximation method.\n\n4. **Compute Nearest Neighbors**: Use the `NearestNeighbors` class to compute the nearest neighbors based on the specified metric.\n\n5. **Return the Results**: Return the indices and distances of the nearest neighbors, and the random projection forest if used.\n\nLet's start coding:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors\nfrom sklearn.random_projection import SparseRandomProjection\n\ndef nearest_neighbors(X, n_neighbors=5, metric='euclidean', metric_params=None, \n                      use_angular_rp_trees=False, random_state=None, \n                      low_memory=False, verbose=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the n_neighbors nearest points for each data point in X under a specified metric.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - X: array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)\n    - n_neighbors: int, number of nearest neighbors to compute\n    - metric: str or callable, the distance metric to use\n    - metric_params: dict, optional, additional keyword arguments for the metric function\n    - use_angular_rp_trees: bool, whether to use angular random projection trees\n    - random_state: int or RandomState instance, optional, random state for approximate computations\n    - low_memory: bool, optional, if True, use a memory-efficient algorithm\n    - verbose: bool, optional, if True, print status data during computation\n\n    Returns:\n    - knn_indices: array, shape (n_samples, n_neighbors), indices of the nearest neighbors\n    - knn_dists: array, shape (n_samples, n_neighbors), distances to the nearest neighbors\n    - rp_forest: list of trees or None, random projection forest used for searching\n    \"\"\"\n    if verbose:\n        print(\"Starting nearest neighbor computation...\")\n\n    # Initialize the random projection forest if needed\n    rp_forest = None\n    if use_angular_rp_trees:\n        if verbose:\n            print(\"Using angular random projection trees for approximation.\")\n        rp_forest = SparseRandomProjection(n_components='auto', random_state=random_state)\n        X_transformed = rp_forest.fit_transform(X)\n    else:\n        X_transformed = X\n\n    # Initialize the NearestNeighbors model\n    nn_model = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=n_neighbors, metric=metric, \n                                metric_params=metric_params, algorithm='auto')\n    \n    # Fit the model\n    nn_model.fit(X_transformed)\n    \n    # Find the nearest neighbors\n    knn_dists, knn_indices = nn_model.kneighbors(X_transformed)\n    \n    if verbose:\n        print(\"Nearest neighbor computation completed.\")\n\n    return knn_indices, knn_dists, rp_forest\n\n# Example usage:\n# X = np.random.rand(100, 5)  # 100 samples, 5 features\n# indices, dists, forest = nearest_neighbors(X, n_neighbors=3, verbose=True)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Imports**: We import `numpy` for handling arrays and `NearestNeighbors` for the nearest neighbor search. `SparseRandomProjection` is used if angular random projection trees are needed.\n\n- **Function Parameters**: The function accepts various parameters to customize the nearest neighbor search, including the metric and whether to use random projection trees.\n\n- **Random Projection Trees**: If `use_angular_rp_trees` is `True`, we transform the data using `SparseRandomProjection`.\n\n- **Nearest Neighbors Computation**: We use `NearestNeighbors` to find the nearest neighbors, which is efficient and supports various metrics.\n\n- **Verbose Output**: If `verbose` is `True`, the function prints status messages to help track the computation progress.\n\nThis function should cover the requirements specified, providing flexibility in terms of metrics and approximation methods.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called nearest_neighbors that computes the n_neighbors nearest points for each data point in X under a specified metric.
