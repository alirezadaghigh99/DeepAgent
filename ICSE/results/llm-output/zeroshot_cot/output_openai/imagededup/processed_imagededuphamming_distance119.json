    "result": "To create a Python function that calculates the Hamming distance between two hash strings, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Function**: Start by defining the function `hamming_distance` with two parameters, `hash1` and `hash2`.\n\n2. **Pad the Hashes**: Ensure both hash strings are 64 bits long by padding them with zeros if necessary.\n\n3. **Calculate the Hamming Distance**: Compare the two strings character by character and count the number of positions at which the corresponding characters are different.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: Return the calculated Hamming distance as a float.\n\nLet's implement this step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function\n\n```python\ndef hamming_distance(hash1: str, hash2: str) -> float:\n```\n\n### Step 2: Pad the Hashes\n\nWe need to ensure both hash strings are 64 characters long. If they are shorter, we pad them with zeros at the beginning.\n\n```python\n    # Pad the hashes to ensure they are 64 characters long\n    hash1 = hash1.zfill(64)\n    hash2 = hash2.zfill(64)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Hamming Distance\n\nWe will iterate over the characters of both strings and count the number of positions where the characters differ.\n\n```python\n    # Initialize the Hamming distance counter\n    distance = 0\n\n    # Calculate the Hamming distance\n    for char1, char2 in zip(hash1, hash2):\n        if char1 != char2:\n            distance += 1\n```\n\n### Step 4: Return the Result\n\nFinally, return the calculated Hamming distance as a float.\n\n```python\n    # Return the Hamming distance as a float\n    return float(distance)\n```\n\n### Complete Function\n\nHere is the complete function:\n\n```python\ndef hamming_distance(hash1: str, hash2: str) -> float:\n    # Pad the hashes to ensure they are 64 characters long\n    hash1 = hash1.zfill(64)\n    hash2 = hash2.zfill(64)\n\n    # Initialize the Hamming distance counter\n    distance = 0\n\n    # Calculate the Hamming distance\n    for char1, char2 in zip(hash1, hash2):\n        if char1 != char2:\n            distance += 1\n\n    # Return the Hamming distance as a float\n    return float(distance)\n```\n\nThis function will calculate the Hamming distance between two hash strings, ensuring they are both 64 characters long by padding with zeros if necessary.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called hamming_distance that calculates the Hamming distance between two hash strings. The function takes two input parameters, hash1 and hash2, both of type string. The function returns a float value representing the Hamming distance between the two hashes. If the length of the hashes is not 64 bits, the function pads the length to be 64 for each hash before calculating the Hamming distance. The output is the calculated Hamming distance between the two hashes.",
