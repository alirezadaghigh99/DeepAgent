    "result": "To create the `load_image` function, we'll break down the task into several steps. We'll use the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to handle image loading and processing, and NumPy to convert the image to an array. We'll also use the `logging` module to handle warnings. Let's start by setting up the function and importing the necessary libraries.\n\n### Step 1: Import Libraries\n\nFirst, we need to import the required libraries.\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport numpy as np\nimport logging\n```\n\n### Step 2: Set Up Logging\n\nSet up the logging configuration to handle warnings.\n\n```python\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Define the Function\n\nDefine the `load_image` function with the specified parameters.\n\n```python\ndef load_image(image_file, target_size=None, grayscale=False, img_formats=None):\n    try:\n        # Open the image file\n        with Image.open(image_file) as img:\n            # Check if the image format is allowed\n            if img_formats and img.format not in img_formats:\n                logging.warning(f\"Image format {img.format} is not allowed.\")\n                return None\n\n            # Convert to grayscale if specified\n            if grayscale:\n                img = img.convert('L')\n\n            # Resize the image if target_size is specified\n            if target_size:\n                img = img.resize(target_size)\n\n            # Convert the image to a NumPy array\n            img_array = np.array(img)\n\n            return img_array\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        logging.warning(f\"An error occurred while loading the image: {e}\")\n        return None\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Opening the Image**: We use `Image.open(image_file)` to open the image file. The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed after processing.\n- **Format Check**: We check if the image format is in the allowed list `img_formats`. If not, a warning is logged, and the function returns `None`.\n- **Grayscale Conversion**: If `grayscale` is `True`, we convert the image to grayscale using `img.convert('L')`.\n- **Resizing**: If `target_size` is provided, we resize the image using `img.resize(target_size)`.\n- **Array Conversion**: Finally, we convert the processed image to a NumPy array using `np.array(img)` and return it.\n- **Exception Handling**: Any exceptions during the process are caught, a warning is logged, and the function returns `None`.\n\nThis function should meet the requirements specified. You can now use it to load and preprocess images as needed.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called load_image that loads an image from a specified path and returns an array version of the image. The function takes the following arguments:\n- image_file: Path to the image file.\n- target_size: Size to resize the input image to (optional).\n- grayscale: A boolean indicating whether to grayscale the image (optional).\n- img_formats: List of allowed image formats that can be loaded.\n\nThe function first opens the image file using the PIL library and checks if the image format is allowed based on the img_formats argument. If the format is not allowed, a warning is logged and None is returned. If the format is allowed, the function preprocesses the image by resizing and grayscaling it if specified, and then returns the processed image as an array.\n\nIf any exceptions occur during the image loading process, a warning is logged and None is returned.",
