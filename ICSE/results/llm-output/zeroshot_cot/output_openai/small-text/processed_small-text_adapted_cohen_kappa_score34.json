    "result": "To create the `_adapted_cohen_kappa_score` function, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: We'll need NumPy for numerical operations and possibly SciKit-Learn for some utilities.\n2. **Define the Function**: Start with the function signature provided.\n3. **Handle Input Validation**: Ensure that `y1` and `y2` are valid and have the same length.\n4. **Calculate the Confusion Matrix**: This will help in calculating observed and expected agreements.\n5. **Calculate Observed Agreement**: This is the proportion of times the raters agree.\n6. **Calculate Expected Agreement**: This is based on the distribution of the labels.\n7. **Handle Perfect Agreement**: If observed agreement is 1, return 1 to avoid division by zero.\n8. **Calculate Cohen's Kappa**: Use the formula to calculate kappa, handling any potential division by zero.\n9. **Return the Result**: Return the calculated kappa score.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n\ndef _adapted_cohen_kappa_score(y1, y2, *, labels=None, weights=None, sample_weight=None):\n    # Validate input lengths\n    if len(y1) != len(y2):\n        raise ValueError(\"The length of y1 and y2 must be the same.\")\n    \n    # If labels are not provided, determine them from the input\n    if labels is None:\n        labels = np.unique(np.concatenate([y1, y2]))\n    \n    # Calculate the confusion matrix\n    cm = confusion_matrix(y1, y2, labels=labels, sample_weight=sample_weight)\n    \n    # Calculate observed agreement\n    n = np.sum(cm)\n    observed_agreement = np.trace(cm) / n\n    \n    # Calculate expected agreement\n    sum0 = np.sum(cm, axis=0)\n    sum1 = np.sum(cm, axis=1)\n    expected_agreement = np.dot(sum0, sum1) / (n ** 2)\n    \n    # Handle perfect agreement\n    if observed_agreement == 1:\n        return 1.0\n    \n    # Calculate Cohen's kappa\n    kappa = (observed_agreement - expected_agreement) / (1 - expected_agreement)\n    \n    return kappa\n\n# Example usage\ny1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\ny2 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nprint(_adapted_cohen_kappa_score(y1, y2))  # Output should be 1.0 for perfect agreement\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the input lists `y1` and `y2` are of the same length.\n- **Confusion Matrix**: Used to calculate observed and expected agreements.\n- **Observed Agreement**: The proportion of times the raters agree.\n- **Expected Agreement**: Calculated based on the marginal sums of the confusion matrix.\n- **Perfect Agreement Handling**: Directly returns 1.0 if the observed agreement is perfect.\n- **Cohen's Kappa Calculation**: Uses the standard formula, with a check to prevent division by zero.\n\nThis function should handle the special case of perfect agreement and prevent division by zero errors effectively.",
