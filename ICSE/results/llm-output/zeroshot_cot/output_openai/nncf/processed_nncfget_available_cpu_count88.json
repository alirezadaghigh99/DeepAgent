    "result": "Sure, let's break down the process of creating the `get_available_cpu_count` function step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Import Necessary Modules\n\nFirst, we need to import the `os` and `psutil` modules. The `os` module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality, and `psutil` is a cross-platform library for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors) in Python.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport psutil\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the Function\n\nNext, we define the function `get_available_cpu_count` with a parameter `logical` that defaults to `True`.\n\n```python\ndef get_available_cpu_count(logical=True):\n```\n\n### Step 3: Implement the Logic to Get CPU Count\n\nInside the function, we will use `psutil` to get the number of CPUs. The `psutil.cpu_count()` function can be used to get the number of logical or physical CPUs.\n\n```python\n    try:\n        # Get the number of CPUs based on the logical parameter\n        cpu_count = psutil.cpu_count(logical=logical)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Handle Exceptions\n\nWe need to handle any exceptions that might occur during the execution of the function. If an exception occurs, we will return 1 as specified.\n\n```python\n    except Exception as e:\n        # In case of any exception, return 1\n        cpu_count = 1\n```\n\n### Step 5: Return the CPU Count\n\nFinally, return the CPU count obtained.\n\n```python\n    return cpu_count\n```\n\n### Step 6: Complete Function\n\nNow, let's put it all together into a complete function:\n\n```python\nimport psutil\n\ndef get_available_cpu_count(logical=True):\n    try:\n        # Get the number of CPUs based on the logical parameter\n        cpu_count = psutil.cpu_count(logical=logical)\n    except Exception as e:\n        # In case of any exception, return 1\n        cpu_count = 1\n    return cpu_count\n```\n\nThis function will return the number of logical or physical CPUs based on the `logical` parameter, and it will handle exceptions by returning 1.",
    "prompt": "Generate a python function called get_available_cpu_count that returns the number of CPUs in the system. The input parameter is a boolean called logical, which determines whether to return the number of physical cores only (if False) or the number of logical cores (if True). The output is an integer representing the number of CPUs. If an exception occurs, the function will return 1. Default value of logical is True",
