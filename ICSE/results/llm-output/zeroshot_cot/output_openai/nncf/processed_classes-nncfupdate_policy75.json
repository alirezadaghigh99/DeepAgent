    "result": "To implement the `update_policy` function for the `DDPG` class, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Sample a batch of experiences** from the replay buffer.\n2. **Normalize the rewards** using a moving average.\n3. **Compute target Q-values** using the target networks.\n4. **Update the critic network** by minimizing the loss between the predicted Q-values and the target Q-values.\n5. **Update the actor network** by maximizing the expected return.\n6. **Perform a soft update** of the target networks.\n7. **Log the losses** for both the actor and critic networks.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nclass DDPG:\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.memory = None  # replay buffer\n        self.actor = None  # actor network\n        self.actor_target = None  # target actor network\n        self.actor_optim = None  # optimizer for actor network\n        self.critic = None  # critic network\n        self.critic_target = None  # target critic network\n        self.critic_optim = None  # optimizer for critic network\n        self.batch_size = None  # batch size for training\n        self.discount = None  # discount factor\n        self.moving_average = 0.0  # moving average of rewards\n        self.moving_alpha = 0.01  # smoothing factor for moving average\n        self.value_loss = 0.0  # loss for critic network\n        self.policy_loss = 0.0  # loss for actor network\n\n    def update_policy(self):\n        # Sample a batch of experiences from the replay buffer\n        states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones = self.memory.sample(self.batch_size)\n\n        # Normalize rewards\n        self.moving_average = self.moving_alpha * rewards.mean() + (1 - self.moving_alpha) * self.moving_average\n        rewards = rewards - self.moving_average\n\n        # Compute target Q-values\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            next_actions = self.actor_target(next_states)\n            target_q_values = self.critic_target(next_states, next_actions)\n            target_q_values = rewards + (1 - dones) * self.discount * target_q_values\n\n        # Update critic network\n        current_q_values = self.critic(states, actions)\n        critic_loss = F.mse_loss(current_q_values, target_q_values)\n        self.critic_optim.zero_grad()\n        critic_loss.backward()\n        self.critic_optim.step()\n\n        # Update actor network\n        predicted_actions = self.actor(states)\n        actor_loss = -self.critic(states, predicted_actions).mean()\n        self.actor_optim.zero_grad()\n        actor_loss.backward()\n        self.actor_optim.step()\n\n        # Perform a soft update of the target networks\n        self.soft_update(self.critic, self.critic_target)\n        self.soft_update(self.actor, self.actor_target)\n\n        # Log the losses\n        self.value_loss = critic_loss.item()\n        self.policy_loss = actor_loss.item()\n\n    def soft_update(self, local_model, target_model, tau=0.001):\n        for target_param, local_param in zip(target_model.parameters(), local_model.parameters()):\n            target_param.data.copy_(tau * local_param.data + (1.0 - tau) * target_param.data)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Replay Buffer Sampling**: We assume `self.memory.sample(self.batch_size)` returns a batch of experiences.\n- **Reward Normalization**: We use a moving average to normalize rewards, which helps stabilize training.\n- **Target Q-Values**: These are computed using the target networks and are used to train the critic.\n- **Critic Update**: The critic is updated by minimizing the mean squared error between the predicted and target Q-values.\n- **Actor Update**: The actor is updated by maximizing the expected return, which is equivalent to minimizing the negative of the critic's output.\n- **Soft Update**: This is a common technique in DDPG to slowly update the target networks towards the learned networks.\n- **Logging**: We store the losses for later analysis or logging.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the actor and critic networks, as well as their optimizers, are properly initialized and that the replay buffer is implemented with a `sample` method.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `update_policy` for the class `DDPG` that updates the actor and critic networks based on a sampled batch of experiences from the replay buffer. The function should normalize the reward, calculate the target Q-values for the critic, and then update the critic and actor networks accordingly. After updating the networks, it should also perform a soft update on the target networks. The function should update the internal attributes `value_loss` and `policy_loss` for logging purposes.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass DDPG:\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.memory = None  # replay buffer\n        self.actor = None  # actor network\n        self.actor_target = None  # target actor network\n        self.actor_optim = None  # optimizer for actor network\n        self.critic = None  # critic network\n        self.critic_target = None  # target critic network\n        self.critic_optim = None  # optimizer for critic network\n        self.batch_size = None  # batch size for training\n        self.discount = None  # discount factor\n        self.moving_average = None  # moving average of rewards\n        self.moving_alpha = None  # smoothing factor for moving average\n        self.value_loss = 0.0  # loss for critic network\n        self.policy_loss = 0.0  # loss for actor network\n        pass\n\n    def update_policy(self):\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
