    "result": "To create the `create_nncf_network` function, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: We need to import the necessary modules from PyTorch and NNCF (Neural Network Compression Framework).\n\n2. **Define the Function**: We'll define the `create_nncf_network` function with the specified parameters.\n\n3. **Handle Dummy Forward Function**: If a `dummy_forward_fn` is provided, it will be used to trace the model. Otherwise, mock inputs will be generated based on the configuration.\n\n4. **Wrap Inputs and Outputs**: If `wrap_inputs_fn` and `wrap_outputs_fn` are provided, they will be used to wrap the inputs and outputs of the model.\n\n5. **Create NNCF Network**: Use the NNCF API to create a network ready for compression.\n\nHere's how the code might look:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom nncf import NNCFNetwork\nfrom nncf.dynamic_graph.context import TracingContext\nfrom nncf.dynamic_graph.graph_builder import create_input_infos\nfrom nncf.nncf_network import InputInfo\n\ndef create_nncf_network(model, config, dummy_forward_fn=None, wrap_inputs_fn=None, wrap_outputs_fn=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Produces a model ready for adding compression from an original PyTorch model and a configuration object.\n\n    :param model: The original model.

The `wrap_inputs_fn` is required in this case to ensure inputs are correctly marked.\n- **NNCF Network Creation**: Finally, we create an `NNCFNetwork` object, which is the model wrapped and ready for compression.\n\nThis function provides a flexible way to prepare a PyTorch model for compression using NNCF, accommodating various input and output handling scenarios.",
