    "result": "To implement the `update_delta_decay_factor` method for the `DDPG` class, we need to follow the specified behavior for updating the delta decay factor based on the number of training episodes. Here's how we can break down the implementation:\n\n1. **Assertion Check**: Ensure that the number of training episodes is greater than zero. If not, raise an `AssertionError`.\n\n2. **Calibrated Values for Episodes Below 1000**: Define specific decay values for episodes less than 1000. For simplicity, let's assume a constant decay factor for this range.\n\n3. **Linear Interpolation for Episodes Between 1000 and 3000**: Calculate the decay factor using linear interpolation between two specified values for episodes in this range.\n\n4. **Constant Decay Factor for Episodes Beyond 3000**: Set a constant decay factor for episodes greater than 3000.\n\nLet's implement the function step by step:\n\n```python\nclass DDPG:\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.delta_decay = None  # Initialize the delta decay factor\n        pass\n\n    def update_delta_decay_factor(self, num_train_episode):\n        # Step 1: Assertion check\n        assert num_train_episode > 0, \"Number of training episodes must be greater than zero.\"\n\n        # Step 2: Calibrated values for episodes below 1000\n        if num_train_episode < 1000:\n            self.delta_decay = 0.9  # Example constant value for episodes < 1000\n\n        # Step 3: Linear interpolation for episodes between 1000 and 3000\n        elif 1000 <= num_train_episode <= 3000:\n            # Linear interpolation between 0.9 and 0.5\n            start_decay = 0.9\n            end_decay = 0.5\n            self.delta_decay = start_decay - ((start_decay - end_decay) / 2000) * (num_train_episode - 1000)\n\n        # Step 4: Constant decay factor for episodes beyond 3000\n        else:\n            self.delta_decay = 0.5  # Example constant value for episodes > 3000\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Assertion**: We ensure that `num_train_episode` is greater than zero to avoid invalid input.\n- **Episodes < 1000**: We set a constant decay factor of `0.9`. This is an arbitrary choice and can be adjusted based on specific requirements.\n- **Episodes 1000 to 3000**: We use linear interpolation to smoothly transition the decay factor from `0.9` to `0.5`.\n- **Episodes > 3000**: We set a constant decay factor of `0.5`.\n\nThis implementation provides a structured way to update the delta decay factor based on the number of training episodes, as specified in the prompt.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `update_delta_decay_factor` for the class `DDPG` that updates the delta decay factor based on the number of training episodes. The function adjusts the decay factor according to specific calibrated values for episodes below 1000, a linear interpolation for episodes between 1000 and 3000, and sets a constant decay factor for episodes beyond 3000.
