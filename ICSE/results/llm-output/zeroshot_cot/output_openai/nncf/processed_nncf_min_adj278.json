    "result": "To generate the `_min_adj` function step by step, we need to break down the problem and understand how each parameter affects the calculation. Here's how we can approach it:\n\n1. **Understand the Parameters:**\n   - `bits`: The number of bits used for quantization. This determines the number of quantization levels.\n   - `low`: The lower bound of the range.\n   - `range_len`: The length of the range.\n   - `narrow_range`: A boolean indicating whether the range is narrow.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Quantization Levels:**\n   - The number of quantization levels (`quants_count`) is typically calculated as \\(2^{\\text{bits}}\\). However, if the range is narrow, the number of levels is reduced by 1.\n\n3. **Calculate the Minimum Adjustment Value:**\n   - The minimum adjustment value can be calculated based on the quantization levels and the range parameters.\n\nLet's implement this step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function and Calculate `quants_count`\n\n```python\ndef _min_adj(bits, low, range_len, narrow_range):\n    # Calculate the number of quantization levels\n    if narrow_range:\n        quants_count = 2 ** bits - 1\n    else:\n        quants_count = 2 ** bits\n    \n    # Return the quantization levels for now\n    return quants_count\n```\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Minimum Adjustment Value\n\nThe minimum adjustment value can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{min\\_adj} = \\frac{\\text{range\\_len}}{\\text{quants\\_count}} \\]\n\nThis formula divides the range length by the number of quantization levels to find the smallest step size.\n\n```python\ndef _min_adj(bits, low, range_len, narrow_range):\n    # Calculate the number of quantization levels\n    if narrow_range:\n        quants_count = 2 ** bits - 1\n    else:\n        quants_count = 2 ** bits\n    \n    # Calculate the minimum adjustment value\n    min_adj = range_len / quants_count\n    \n    return min_adj\n```\n\n### Step 3: Consider the Lower Bound\n\nIf the lower bound (`low`) affects the calculation, it might be used to adjust the minimum adjustment value. However, based on the typical quantization process, the lower bound is not directly used in calculating the minimum adjustment value. Therefore, the current implementation should suffice unless additional context specifies otherwise.\n\n### Final Function\n\nHere is the complete function:\n\n```python\ndef _min_adj(bits, low, range_len, narrow_range):\n    # Calculate the number of quantization levels\n    if narrow_range:\n        quants_count = 2 ** bits - 1\n    else:\n        quants_count = 2 ** bits\n    \n    # Calculate the minimum adjustment value\n    min_adj = range_len / quants_count\n    \n    return min_adj\n```\n\nThis function calculates the minimum adjustment value based on the given parameters, considering whether the range is narrow or not.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called _min_adj that calculates the minimum adjustment value based on the input parameters. The function takes in the number of bits (bits), the lower bound (low), the length of the range (range_len), and a boolean value indicating whether the range is narrow (narrow_range). The function calculates the number of quantization levels (quants_count), and then returns the result",
