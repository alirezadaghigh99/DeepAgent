    "result": "To implement the `select_action` function for the `DDPG` class, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Predict the Action**: Use the actor network to predict the action based on the current state `s_t`.\n\n2. **Apply Noise**: If `decay_epsilon` is `True`, apply noise to the action. The noise should be sampled from a truncated normal distribution with a standard deviation that decays over time.\n\n3. **Clip the Action**: Ensure the action is within the bounds defined by `LBOUND` and `RBOUND`.\n\nLet's implement this step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Predict the Action\n\nFirst, we need to use the actor network to predict the action. We'll assume that the actor network has a method `predict` that takes the state as input and returns the action.\n\n### Step 2: Apply Noise\n\nIf `decay_epsilon` is `True`, we apply noise to the action. The noise is sampled from a truncated normal distribution. The standard deviation of the noise (`self.delta`) should decay over time, which is controlled by `self.delta_decay`.\n\n### Step 3: Clip the Action\n\nFinally, we clip the action to ensure it stays within the bounds defined by `LBOUND` and `RBOUND`.\n\nHere's the complete implementation of the `select_action` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import truncnorm\n\nclass DDPG:\n    LBOUND = 0.0\n    RBOUND = 1.0\n\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.actor = None  # actor network\n        self.init_delta = 0.5  # initial delta for noise\n        self.delta_decay = 0.995  # decay rate for delta\n        self.warmup_iter_number = 20  # number of warmup iterations\n        self.nb_actions = nb_actions  # number of actions\n        self.delta = self.init_delta  # current delta for noise\n\n    def select_action(self, s_t, episode, decay_epsilon=True):\n        # Step 1: Predict the action using the actor network\n        action = self.actor.predict(s_t)\n\n        # Step 2: Apply noise if decay_epsilon is True\n        if decay_epsilon:\n            # Decay the delta\n            self.delta *= self.delta_decay\n\n            # Sample noise from a truncated normal distribution\n            noise = truncnorm.rvs(\n                (self.LBOUND - action) / self.delta, \n                (self.RBOUND - action) / self.delta, \n                loc=0, \n                scale=self.delta, \n                size=self.nb_actions\n            )\n\n            # Add noise to the action\n            action += noise\n\n        # Step 3: Clip the action to be within the bounds\n        action = np.clip(action, self.LBOUND, self.RBOUND)\n\n        return action\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Truncated Normal Distribution**: We use `truncnorm.rvs` to sample noise. The parameters `(self.LBOUND - action) / self.delta` and `(self.RBOUND - action) / self.delta` ensure the noise is truncated to keep the action within bounds.\n  \n- **Decay of `delta`**: The `self.delta` is multiplied by `self.delta_decay` to reduce the noise over time, encouraging exploration initially and more stable actions later.\n\n- **Clipping**: `np.clip` ensures the final action is within the specified bounds.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the actor network has a `predict` method that returns the action for a given state. Adjust the method call if your actor network uses a different interface.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `select_action` for the class `DDPG` that selects an action based on the current state `s_t` and the current episode number. The function should use the actor network to predict the action, and if `decay_epsilon` is `True`, it should apply noise to the action by sampling from a truncated normal distribution with a decaying standard deviation (`self.delta`). The function should then clip the action to be within the bounds defined by `LBOUND` and `RBOUND`.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass DDPG:\n    LBOUND = 0.0\n    RBOUND = 1.0\n\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.actor = None  # actor network\n        self.init_delta = 0.5  # initial delta for noise\n        self.delta_decay = 0.995  # decay rate for delta\n        self.warmup_iter_number = 20  # number of warmup iterations\n        self.nb_actions = nb_actions  # number of actions\n        pass\n\n    def select_action(self, s_t, episode, decay_epsilon=True):\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```\n\nThis function should output a clipped action that is within the defined bounds, applying noise to encourage exploration during training.",
