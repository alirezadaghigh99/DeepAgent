    "result": "To create the `train_agent` function, we need to break down the task into several steps. We'll start by setting up the function signature and initializing necessary variables. Then, we'll implement the main training loop, handle logging, evaluation, and saving the model. Finally, we'll return the evaluation statistics. Let's go through this step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Function Signature and Initialize Variables\n\nFirst, we define the function signature with the specified parameters and initialize variables for tracking episode rewards, episode index, and other necessary components.\n\n```python\ndef train_agent(agent, env, steps, outdir, checkpoint_freq=None, max_episode_len=None, \n                step_offset=0, evaluator=None, successful_score=None, step_hooks=None, \n                eval_during_episode=False, logger=None):\n    # Initialize variables\n    episode_rewards = []\n    episode_idx = 0\n    eval_stats_history = []\n    total_steps = step_offset\n    observation = env.reset()\n    episode_reward = 0\n    done = False\n```\n\n### Step 2: Implement the Main Training Loop\n\nNext, we implement the main loop that runs for the specified number of steps. In each iteration, the agent takes an action, observes the outcome, and updates its policy.\n\n```python\n    while total_steps < steps:\n        # Select an action from the agent\n        action = agent.act(observation)\n        \n        # Take the action in the environment\n        next_observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)\n        \n        # Update the agent with the new experience\n        agent.observe(observation, action, reward, next_observation, done)\n        \n        # Update the current observation\n        observation = next_observation\n        \n        # Accumulate the reward\n        episode_reward += reward\n        total_steps += 1\n        \n        # Call step hooks if any\n        if step_hooks:\n            for hook in step_hooks:\n                hook(env, agent, total_steps)\n        \n        # Check if the episode is done\n        if done or (max_episode_len and total_steps % max_episode_len == 0):\n            # Log the episode reward\n            if logger:\n                logger.info(f'Episode {episode_idx} finished with reward: {episode_reward}')\n            \n            # Reset the environment for the next episode\n            observation = env.reset()\n            episode_rewards.append(episode_reward)\n            episode_reward = 0\n            episode_idx += 1\n            done = False\n        \n        # Evaluate the agent if needed\n        if evaluator and (eval_during_episode or done):\n            eval_stats = evaluator.evaluate(agent)\n            eval_stats_history.append(eval_stats)\n            if logger:\n                logger.info(f'Evaluation at step {total_steps}: {eval_stats}')\n            \n            # Check for successful score\n            if successful_score and eval_stats.get('mean_reward', 0) >= successful_score:\n                if logger:\n                    logger.info(f'Successful score reached: {eval_stats[\"mean_reward\"]}')\n                agent.save(outdir)\n                break\n        \n        # Save the agent's model at checkpoints\n        if checkpoint_freq and total_steps % checkpoint_freq == 0:\n            agent.save(outdir)\n            if logger:\n                logger.info(f'Checkpoint saved at step {total_steps}')\n```\n\n### Step 3: Handle Exceptions and Return Evaluation Statistics\n\nFinally, we handle any exceptions that might occur during training and ensure the model is saved. We then return the evaluation statistics history.\n\n```python\n    try:\n        # Main training loop\n        while total_steps < steps:\n            # (The loop code from Step 2 goes here)\n            pass\n    except Exception as e:\n        if logger:\n            logger.error(f'Exception occurred: {e}')\n        agent.save(outdir)\n        raise\n    finally:\n        # Ensure the model is saved at the end\n        agent.save(outdir)\n    \n    return eval_stats_history\n```\n\n### Complete Function\n\nHere is the complete `train_agent` function:\n\n```python\ndef train_agent(agent, env, steps, outdir, checkpoint_freq=None, max_episode_len=None, \n                step_offset=0, evaluator=None, successful_score=None, step_hooks=None, \n                eval_during_episode=False, logger=None):\n    # Initialize variables\n    episode_rewards = []\n    episode_idx = 0\n    eval_stats_history = []\n    total_steps = step_offset\n    observation = env.reset()\n    episode_reward = 0\n    done = False\n    \n    try:\n        while total_steps < steps:\n            # Select an action from the agent\n            action = agent.act(observation)\n            \n            # Take the action in the environment\n            next_observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)\n            \n            # Update the agent with the new experience\n            agent.observe(observation, action, reward, next_observation, done)\n            \n            # Update the current observation\n            observation = next_observation\n            \n            # Accumulate the reward\n            episode_reward += reward\n            total_steps += 1\n            \n            # Call step hooks if any\n            if step_hooks:\n                for hook in step_hooks:\n                    hook(env, agent, total_steps)\n            \n            # Check if the episode is done\n            if done or (max_episode_len and total_steps % max_episode_len == 0):\n                # Log the episode reward\n                if logger:\n                    logger.info(f'Episode {episode_idx} finished with reward: {episode_reward}')\n                \n                # Reset the environment for the next episode\n                observation = env.reset()\n                episode_rewards.append(episode_reward)\n                episode_reward = 0\n                episode_idx += 1\n                done = False\n            \n            # Evaluate the agent if needed\n            if evaluator and (eval_during_episode or done):\n                eval_stats = evaluator.evaluate(agent)\n                eval_stats_history.append(eval_stats)\n                if logger:\n                    logger.info(f'Evaluation at step {total_steps}: {eval_stats}')\n                \n                # Check for successful score\n                if successful_score and eval_stats.get('mean_reward', 0) >= successful_score:\n                    if logger:\n                        logger.info(f'Successful score reached: {eval_stats[\"mean_reward\"]}')\n                    agent.save(outdir)\n                    break\n            \n            # Save the agent's model at checkpoints\n            if checkpoint_freq and total_steps % checkpoint_freq == 0:\n                agent.save(outdir)\n                if logger:\n                    logger.info(f'Checkpoint saved at step {total_steps}')\n    except Exception as e:\n        if logger:\n            logger.error(f'Exception occurred: {e}')\n        agent.save(outdir)\n        raise\n    finally:\n        # Ensure the model is saved at the end\n        agent.save(outdir)\n    \n    return eval_stats_history\n```\n\nThis function provides a comprehensive framework for training an agent in a reinforcement learning environment, with options for logging, evaluation, and model saving.",
    "prompt": "Define a Python function called train_agent that takes in the following parameters: agent, env, steps, outdir, checkpoint_freq (optional), max_episode_len (optional), step_offset (default 0), evaluator (optional), successful_score (optional), step_hooks (optional), eval_during_episode (default False), and logger (optional). The function runs a training loop for the agent in the environment for a specified number of steps. It logs the progress and evaluates the agent's performance during training.\n\nThe function initializes variables for episode rewards and index, resets the environment, and iterates through steps while taking actions, observing outcomes, and updating the agent. It also handles episode endings, logging statistics, and evaluating the agent's performance. If a successful score is achieved or an exception occurs, the function saves the agent's model. Finally, it returns a list of evaluation statistics history.\n\nThe output of the function is a list of evaluation episode statistics dictionaries.",
