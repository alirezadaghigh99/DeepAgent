The function takes three inputs: y (an ndarray representing values of atoms before projection with shape (batch_size, n_atoms)), y_probs (an ndarray representing probabilities of atoms with shape (batch_size, n_atoms)), and z (an ndarray representing values of atoms after projection with shape (n_atoms,)).
