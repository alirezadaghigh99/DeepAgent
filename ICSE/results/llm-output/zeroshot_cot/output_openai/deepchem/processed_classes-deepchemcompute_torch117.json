    "result": "To generate the `_compute_pytorch_loss` function step by step, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: We need to import PyTorch since we are using it to compute the loss.\n\n2. **Handle Input Shapes**: The function should handle both 2D and 3D input shapes for logits and labels.\n\n3. **Compute Softmax Cross Entropy Loss**: Use PyTorch's built-in functions to compute the softmax cross entropy loss.\n\n4. **Return the Loss**: The function should return the computed loss.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries\n\nFirst, we need to import PyTorch.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n```\n\n### Step 2: Handle Input Shapes\n\nThe function should be able to handle both 2D and 3D input shapes. We can use PyTorch's `view` or `reshape` to flatten the inputs if necessary.\n\n### Step 3: Compute Softmax Cross Entropy Loss\n\nWe can use `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy` to compute the loss. This function combines `log_softmax` and `nll_loss` in a single function.\n\n### Step 4: Return the Loss\n\nFinally, return the computed loss.\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nclass SoftmaxCrossEntropy:\n    def _compute_pytorch_loss(self, output, labels):\n        # Check if the input is 3D (batch_size, tasks, classes)\n        if output.dim() == 3:\n            # Reshape to (batch_size * tasks, classes)\n            output = output.view(-1, output.size(-1))\n            labels = labels.view(-1)\n        \n        # Compute the softmax cross entropy loss\n        loss = F.cross_entropy(output, labels)\n        \n        return loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Handling 3D Inputs**: If the input is 3D, we flatten it to 2D by combining the batch size and tasks dimensions. This is necessary because `F.cross_entropy` expects a 2D tensor for logits and a 1D tensor for labels.\n  \n- **Computing the Loss**: We use `F.cross_entropy` which computes the softmax and the negative log likelihood loss in one step.\n\nThis function will correctly compute the softmax cross entropy loss for both 2D and 3D input shapes.",
