    "result": "To generate the Python function `_create_pytorch_loss` for the class `L2Loss`, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Class**: We will start by defining the `L2Loss` class, which inherits from a base class `Loss`.\n\n2. **Implement the `_create_pytorch_loss` Method**: This method will create a PyTorch loss function to calculate the mean squared error (MSE) loss. We will ensure that the shapes of `output` and `labels` are consistent and compute the MSE loss without reduction.\n\n3. **Use PyTorch Operations**: We will use PyTorch operations to compute the MSE loss.\n\nHere is the complete code:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass Loss:\n    # Assuming there is a base Loss class with some functionality\n    pass\n\nclass L2Loss(Loss):\n    def _create_pytorch_loss(self):\n        def mse_loss(output, labels):\n            # Ensure the shapes of output and labels are consistent\n            if output.shape != labels.shape:\n                raise ValueError(\"Output and labels must have the same shape\")\n            \n            # Compute the mean squared error loss without reduction\n            loss = (output - labels) ** 2\n            return loss\n        \n        return mse_loss\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    l2_loss = L2Loss()\n    mse_loss_fn = l2_loss._create_pytorch_loss()\n    \n    # Example tensors\n    output = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\n    labels = torch.tensor([1.5, 2.5, 3.5])\n    \n    # Calculate the loss\n    loss = mse_loss_fn(output, labels)\n    print(loss)  # Output: tensor([0.2500, 0.2500, 0.2500])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Shape Consistency Check**: We first check if the shapes of `output` and `labels` are the same. If not, we raise a `ValueError`.\n\n- **MSE Loss Calculation**: We calculate the MSE loss by taking the element-wise difference between `output` and `labels`, squaring it, and returning the result. This is done without any reduction (i.e., we do not sum or average the loss values).\n\n- **Example Usage**: We demonstrate how to use the `L2Loss` class to create an MSE loss function and calculate the loss for example tensors.",
