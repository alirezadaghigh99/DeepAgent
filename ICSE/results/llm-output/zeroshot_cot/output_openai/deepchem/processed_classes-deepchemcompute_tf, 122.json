    "result": "To generate the `_compute_tf_loss` function for calculating the sigmoid cross-entropy loss using TensorFlow, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import TensorFlow**: Ensure that TensorFlow is imported so that we can use its functions and operations.\n\n2. **Define the Function**: Implement the `_compute_tf_loss` method within the `SigmoidCrossEntropy` class.\n\n3. **Calculate the Loss**: Use TensorFlow's built-in function to compute the sigmoid cross-entropy loss.\n\n4. **Return the Loss**: Return the computed loss tensor.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.losses import Loss\n\nclass SigmoidCrossEntropy(Loss):\n    def _compute_tf_loss(self, output, labels):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the sigmoid cross-entropy loss between logits and labels.\n\n        Args:\n            output (tf.Tensor): The output logits with shape (batch_size,) or (batch_size, tasks).\n            labels (tf.Tensor): The true labels with shape (batch_size,) or (batch_size, tasks).\n\n        Returns:\n            tf.Tensor: The computed loss values.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Use TensorFlow's sigmoid cross-entropy function\n        loss = tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=output)\n        \n        # Reduce the loss across the batch\n        loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss)\n        \n        return loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Import TensorFlow**: We import TensorFlow to access its functions and operations.\n\n- **Sigmoid Cross-Entropy Loss**: The function `tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits` computes the sigmoid cross-entropy loss between the logits and the labels. This function is numerically stable and is the recommended way to compute this loss in TensorFlow.\n\n- **Reduce Mean**: We use `tf.reduce_mean` to average the loss over the batch, which is a common practice to ensure that the loss is a single scalar value that can be used for optimization.\n\nThis function will compute the sigmoid cross-entropy loss for each element in the batch and then average these losses to return a single scalar loss value.",
