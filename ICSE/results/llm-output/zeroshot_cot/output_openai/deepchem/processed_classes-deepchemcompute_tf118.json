    "result": "To generate the `_compute_tf_loss` function step by step, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Import TensorFlow**: Ensure that TensorFlow is imported to use its functions.\n2. **Handle Different Input Shapes**: The function should handle both 2D and 3D input shapes for logits and labels.\n3. **Compute Softmax Cross Entropy Loss**: Use TensorFlow's built-in functions to compute the softmax cross entropy loss.\n4. **Return the Loss**: The function should return the computed loss.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Import TensorFlow\n\nFirst, we need to import TensorFlow to access its functionalities.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the Function\n\nDefine the `_compute_tf_loss` function within the `SoftmaxCrossEntropy` class.\n\n```python\nclass SoftmaxCrossEntropy(Loss):\n    def _compute_tf_loss(self, output, labels):\n```\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Loss\n\nUse TensorFlow's `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` to compute the loss. This function expects logits and one-hot encoded labels.\n\n- If the input is 3D, we need to reshape it to 2D before computing the loss and then reshape the loss back to the original batch and task dimensions.\n\n```python\nclass SoftmaxCrossEntropy(Loss):\n    def _compute_tf_loss(self, output, labels):\n        # Check if the input is 3D\n        if len(output.shape) == 3:\n            # Reshape to 2D\n            batch_size, tasks, classes = output.shape\n            output = tf.reshape(output, [-1, classes])\n            labels = tf.reshape(labels, [-1, classes])\n        \n        # Compute the softmax cross entropy loss\n        loss = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=output)\n        \n        # If the input was 3D, reshape the loss back to 2D\n        if len(output.shape) == 3:\n            loss = tf.reshape(loss, [batch_size, tasks])\n        \n        return loss\n```\n\n### Step 4: Return the Loss\n\nThe function should return the computed loss tensor.\n\nHere's the complete function:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nclass SoftmaxCrossEntropy(Loss):\n    def _compute_tf_loss(self, output, labels):\n        # Check if the input is 3D\n        if len(output.shape) == 3:\n            # Reshape to 2D\n            batch_size, tasks, classes = output.shape\n            output = tf.reshape(output, [-1, classes])\n            labels = tf.reshape(labels, [-1, classes])\n        \n        # Compute the softmax cross entropy loss\n        loss = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=output)\n        \n        # If the input was 3D, reshape the loss back to 2D\n        if len(output.shape) == 3:\n            loss = tf.reshape(loss, [batch_size, tasks])\n        \n        return loss\n```\n\nThis function will compute the softmax cross entropy loss for both 2D and 3D input shapes, handling the reshaping as necessary.",
