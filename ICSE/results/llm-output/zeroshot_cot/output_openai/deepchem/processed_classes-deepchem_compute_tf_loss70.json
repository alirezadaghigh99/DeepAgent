    "result": "To generate the `_compute_tf_loss` function for the `L2Loss` class, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import TensorFlow**: Ensure that TensorFlow is imported since we will use its operations to compute the L2 loss.\n\n2. **Check Input Types**: Verify that both `output` and `labels` are of float type. This is important for numerical stability and correctness.\n\n3. **Check Shape Consistency**: Ensure that the shapes of `output` and `labels` are consistent. This means they should be the same shape to compute the element-wise squared difference.\n\n4. **Compute Squared Difference**: Use TensorFlow operations to compute the squared difference between `output` and `labels`.\n\n5. **Compute Mean of Squared Differences**: Calculate the mean of these squared differences to get the L2 loss.\n\nHere is the code implementing these steps:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.losses import Loss\n\nclass L2Loss(Loss):\n    def _compute_tf_loss(self, output, labels):\n        # Ensure the inputs are of float type\n        output = tf.convert_to_tensor(output, dtype=tf.float32)\n        labels = tf.convert_to_tensor(labels, dtype=tf.float32)\n        \n        # Check that the shapes of output and labels are the same\n        tf.debugging.assert_shapes([(output, labels.shape)], \n                                   message=\"Output and labels must have the same shape.\")\n        \n        # Compute the squared difference\n        squared_difference = tf.square(output - labels)\n        \n        # Compute the mean of the squared differences\n        loss = tf.reduce_mean(squared_difference)\n        \n        return loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Import TensorFlow**: We import TensorFlow and the `Loss` class from `tensorflow.keras.losses`.\n\n- **Convert to Tensor**: We convert `output` and `labels` to TensorFlow tensors with `dtype=tf.float32` to ensure they are of float type.\n\n- **Shape Assertion**: We use `tf.debugging.assert_shapes` to ensure that `output` and `labels` have the same shape. This is crucial for element-wise operations.\n\n- **Squared Difference**: We compute the squared difference using `tf.square(output - labels)`.\n\n- **Mean of Squared Differences**: Finally, we compute the mean of these squared differences using `tf.reduce_mean`, which gives us the L2 loss.\n\nThis function will compute the L2 loss correctly, assuming the inputs are valid.",
