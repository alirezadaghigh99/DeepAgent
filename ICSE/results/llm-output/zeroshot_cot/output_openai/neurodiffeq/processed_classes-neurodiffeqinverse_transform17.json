    "result": "To complete the `inverse_transform` function, we need to apply the inverse transformation to the whitened data `x`. This typically involves using a precomputed inverse transformation matrix, which is stored in `self.transform_inv`. Let's break down the steps needed to complete the function:\n\n1. **Check Preconditions**: Ensure that the transformation has been fitted and that the inverse transformation matrix is available. This is already handled by the initial checks in the provided code.\n\n2. **Apply the Inverse Transformation**: Use the inverse transformation matrix to convert the whitened data back to its original form. This is typically done using matrix multiplication.\n\n3. **Return the Original Data**: After applying the inverse transformation, return the resulting tensor.\n\nHere's how you can implement these steps in the function:\n\n```python\ndef inverse_transform(self, x: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n    r\"\"\"Apply the inverse transform to the whitened data.\n\n    Args:\n        x: Whitened data.\n\n    Returns:\n        Original data.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not self.fitted:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Needs to be fitted first before running. Please call fit or set include_fit to True.\")\n\n    if not self.compute_inv:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Did not compute inverse ZCA. Please set compute_inv to True\")\n\n    if self.transform_inv is None:\n        raise TypeError(\"The transform inverse should be a Tensor. Gotcha None.\")\n\n    # Apply the inverse transformation\n    original_data = x @ self.transform_inv\n\n    # Return the original data\n    return original_data\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Matrix Multiplication**: The `@` operator is used for matrix multiplication in PyTorch. It multiplies the whitened data `x` by the inverse transformation matrix `self.transform_inv` to obtain the original data.\n\n- **Return Statement**: The function returns the `original_data`, which is the result of applying the inverse transformation to `x`.\n\nThis implementation assumes that `self.transform_inv` is a valid transformation matrix that was computed during the fitting process.",
