    "result": "To implement the `_normalize` method for the `RCF` class, we need to follow the steps for ZCA whitening, which involves centering the data, normalizing it, and then applying the ZCA transformation. Let's break down the implementation step by step:\n\n1. **Centering the Data**: Subtract the mean of each patch to center the data around zero.\n\n2. **Normalizing the Data**: Scale the patches so that each has a unit norm. This involves dividing each patch by its L2 norm.\n\n3. **ZCA Whitening**: Apply the ZCA whitening transformation, which involves computing the covariance matrix, performing singular value decomposition (SVD), and then transforming the data.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `_normalize` method:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nclass RCF:\n    def __init__(self, in_channels: int = 4, features: int = 16, kernel_size: int = 3, bias: float = -1.0, seed: int | None = None, mode: str = 'gaussian', dataset: None = None):\n        self.weights = ...\n        self.biases = ...\n        pass\n\n    def _normalize(self, patches: np.ndarray, min_divisor: float = 1e-8, zca_bias: float = 0.001) -> np.ndarray:\n        # Step 1: Center the data\n        N, C, H, W = patches.shape\n        patches = patches.reshape(N, -1)  # Reshape to (N, C*H*W)\n        mean = np.mean(patches, axis=0)\n        patches -= mean\n\n        # Step 2: Normalize the data to have unit norm\n        norms = np.linalg.norm(patches, axis=1, keepdims=True)\n        norms = np.maximum(norms, min_divisor)  # Avoid division by zero\n        patches /= norms\n\n        # Step 3: ZCA Whitening\n        # Compute the covariance matrix\n        covariance_matrix = np.cov(patches, rowvar=False)\n\n        # Singular Value Decomposition\n        U, S, V = np.linalg.svd(covariance_matrix)\n\n        # Compute the ZCA matrix\n        S_inv_sqrt = np.diag(1.0 / np.sqrt(S + zca_bias))\n        zca_matrix = U @ S_inv_sqrt @ U.T\n\n        # Apply the ZCA transformation\n        patches = patches @ zca_matrix\n\n        # Reshape back to original shape\n        patches = patches.reshape(N, C, H, W)\n\n        return patches\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Centering**: We first reshape the patches to a 2D array of shape `(N, C*H*W)` to simplify the mean subtraction. The mean is computed along the feature axis and subtracted from each patch.\n\n- **Normalizing**: We compute the L2 norm of each patch and ensure it's not below `min_divisor` to prevent division by zero. Each patch is then divided by its norm.\n\n- **ZCA Whitening**: We compute the covariance matrix of the centered and normalized patches. Using SVD, we decompose the covariance matrix and compute the ZCA transformation matrix. The patches are then transformed using this matrix.\n\n- **Reshape**: Finally, we reshape the patches back to their original 4D shape `(N, C, H, W)`.\n\nThis method will return the normalized and whitened patches as required.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `_normalize` for the `RCF` class that performs ZCA whitening on a set of input patches. The method should normalize the patches by removing the mean, normalizing the patches to have unit norms, and then applying ZCA whitening. The method should take as input a NumPy array `patches` of shape `(N, C, H, W)` and return a normalized NumPy array of the same shape. Additional parameters should include `min_divisor` to prevent division by zero and `zca_bias` to add a small bias during whitening. The method should follow the ZCA whitening steps as specified in the `mosaiks-paper` repository.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass RCF:\n    def __init__(self, in_channels: int = 4, features: int = 16, kernel_size: int = 3, bias: float = -1.0, seed: int | None = None, mode: str = 'gaussian', dataset: NonGeoDataset | None = None):\n        self.weights = ...\n        self.biases = ...\n        pass\n\n    def _normalize(self, patches: np.typing.NDArray[np.float32], min_divisor: float = 1e-8, zca_bias: float = 0.001) -> np.typing.NDArray[np.float32]:\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
