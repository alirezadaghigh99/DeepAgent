    "result": "To implement the `forward` method for the `RCF` class, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Convolution Operations**: Apply two convolution operations using `self.weights` and `self.biases`.\n2. **ReLU Activation**: Apply the ReLU activation function after each convolution.\n3. **Adaptive Average Pooling**: Pool the outputs using adaptive average pooling.\n4. **Concatenation**: Concatenate the pooled outputs. If a single input is passed, concatenate along the channel dimension; if a batch is passed, concatenate along the feature dimension.\n\nLet's break down the implementation step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Convolution Operations\n\nWe need to define the convolution operations using the weights and biases. Assuming `self.weights` and `self.biases` are lists of tensors for the convolution layers, we can use PyTorch's `F.conv2d` function.\n\n### Step 2: ReLU Activation\n\nWe can use `F.relu` from PyTorch to apply the ReLU activation function.\n\n### Step 3: Adaptive Average Pooling\n\nWe can use `F.adaptive_avg_pool2d` to perform adaptive average pooling.\n\n### Step 4: Concatenation\n\nWe will use `torch.cat` to concatenate the outputs. The dimension for concatenation will depend on whether the input is a single image or a batch.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom torch import Tensor\n\nclass RCF:\n    def __init__(self, in_channels: int = 4, features: int = 16, kernel_size: int = 3, bias: float = -1.0, seed: int | None = None, mode: str = 'gaussian', dataset: None = None):\n        # Initialize weights and biases for two convolution layers\n        self.weights = [\n            torch.randn(features, in_channels, kernel_size, kernel_size),\n            torch.randn(features, features, kernel_size, kernel_size)\n        ]\n        self.biases = [\n            torch.full((features,), bias),\n            torch.full((features,), bias)\n        ]\n        self.num_features = features * 2  # Assuming two features are concatenated\n\n    def forward(self, x: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # First convolution and ReLU\n        out1 = F.conv2d(x, self.weights[0], self.biases[0], padding=1)\n        out1 = F.relu(out1)\n        \n        # Second convolution and ReLU\n        out2 = F.conv2d(out1, self.weights[1], self.biases[1], padding=1)\n        out2 = F.relu(out2)\n        \n        # Adaptive average pooling\n        pooled1 = F.adaptive_avg_pool2d(out1, (1, 1))\n        pooled2 = F.adaptive_avg_pool2d(out2, (1, 1))\n        \n        # Concatenate pooled outputs\n        if x.shape[0] == 1:  # Single input\n            result = torch.cat((pooled1, pooled2), dim=1)\n        else:  # Batch input\n            result = torch.cat((pooled1, pooled2), dim=1)\n        \n        # Flatten the result to match the desired output shape\n        return result.view(x.size(0), -1)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Convolution and ReLU**: We apply two convolution layers followed by ReLU activation.\n- **Adaptive Average Pooling**: We pool the outputs to a size of `(1, 1)`.\n- **Concatenation**: We concatenate the pooled outputs along the channel dimension for a single input or along the feature dimension for a batch.\n- **Flattening**: We flatten the result to ensure the output shape is `(B, self.num_features)`.\n\nThis implementation assumes that `self.weights` and `self.biases` are initialized properly and that the input tensor `x` is a 4D tensor with shape `(B, C, H, W)`.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `forward` for the `RCF` class that performs the forward pass of the model. The method should take as input a tensor `x` with shape `(B, C, H, W)` and return a tensor of size `(B, self.num_features)`. The method should apply two convolution operations using `self.weights` and `self.biases`, followed by ReLU activation. The outputs should be pooled using adaptive average pooling, concatenated, and returned as a single tensor. If a single input is passed, the concatenation should occur along the channel dimension; if a batch is passed, it should occur along the feature dimension.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass RCF:\n    def __init__(self, in_channels: int = 4, features: int = 16, kernel_size: int = 3, bias: float = -1.0, seed: int | None = None, mode: str = 'gaussian', dataset: NonGeoDataset | None = None):\n        self.weights = ...\n        self.biases = ...\n        pass\n\n    def forward(self, x: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
