    "result": "To complete the `position_embedding` function, we need to generate a sine/cosine position embedding for a given list of positions. The embedding dimension must be even, and the function should return a tensor of position embeddings. Here's how you can implement this step by step:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: Ensure you have the necessary imports for handling tensors. Since the function signature uses `Tensor`, we assume you're using PyTorch.\n\n2. **Calculate the Divisor for Frequencies**: The position embedding uses sine and cosine functions with different frequencies. These frequencies are typically calculated using a geometric progression.\n\n3. **Compute the Embeddings**: For each position, compute the sine and cosine values for each dimension.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: The result should be a tensor of shape `(M, D)` where `M` is the number of positions and `D` is the embedding dimension.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\n\ndef position_embedding(embed_dim: int, pos: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n    \"\"\"Compute the 1D sine/cosine position embedding.\n\n    Args:\n        embed_dim: Output dimension D for each position. Must be even.\n        pos: A list of positions to be encoded, of size (M,).\n\n    Returns:\n        Position embeddings of size (M, D).\n\n    Raises:\n        AssertionError: If *embed_dim* is not even.\n    \"\"\"\n    assert embed_dim % 2 == 0, \"Embedding dimension must be even.\"\n\n    # Calculate the divisor for the frequencies\n    div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, embed_dim, 2).float() * (-torch.log(torch.tensor(10000.0)) / embed_dim))\n\n    # Compute the position embeddings\n    pos = pos.unsqueeze(1)  # Shape (M, 1)\n    embeddings = torch.zeros(pos.size(0), embed_dim)  # Shape (M, D)\n\n    embeddings[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(pos * div_term)  # Apply sine to even indices\n    embeddings[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(pos * div_term)  # Apply cosine to odd indices\n\n    return embeddings\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Divisor Calculation**: The `div_term` is calculated using a geometric progression that scales the frequencies for the sine and cosine functions. This is a common technique in position embeddings to ensure that each dimension has a unique frequency.\n\n- **Embedding Calculation**: For each position, we calculate the sine and cosine values for each dimension. The sine values are assigned to even indices, and the cosine values are assigned to odd indices.\n\n- **Tensor Operations**: We use PyTorch tensor operations to efficiently compute the embeddings for all positions at once.\n\nThis implementation should work for any even `embed_dim` and a tensor `pos` containing the positions to be encoded.",
