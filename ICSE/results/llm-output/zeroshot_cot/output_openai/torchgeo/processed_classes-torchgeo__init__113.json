    "result": "To generate the `__init__` function for the `FCN` class, we need to define the layers of the fully convolutional network. We'll use PyTorch's `nn.Module` as the base class and `nn.Conv2d` for the convolutional layers. We'll also use `nn.LeakyReLU` for the activation functions. Here's how you can implement the `__init__` function step by step:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Modules**: Ensure you have the necessary PyTorch modules imported.\n\n2. **Define the Class and Constructor**: Start by defining the class and its constructor.\n\n3. **Initialize the Layers**: Create the convolutional layers with the specified number of filters and 'same' padding. Use `nn.LeakyReLU` for the activation functions.\n\n4. **Store the Layers**: Use `nn.Sequential` to store the layers in a sequential container.\n\nHere's the complete code for the `__init__` function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass FCN(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, in_channels: int, classes: int, num_filters: int = 64) -> None:\n        super(FCN, self).__init__()\n        \n        # Define the 5-layer fully convolutional network\n        self.layer1 = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Conv2d(in_channels, num_filters, kernel_size=3, padding='same'),\n            nn.LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.01)\n        )\n        \n        self.layer2 = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Conv2d(num_filters, num_filters, kernel_size=3, padding='same'),\n            nn.LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.01)\n        )\n        \n        self.layer3 = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Conv2d(num_filters, num_filters, kernel_size=3, padding='same'),\n            nn.LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.01)\n        )\n        \n        self.layer4 = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Conv2d(num_filters, num_filters, kernel_size=3, padding='same'),\n            nn.LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.01)\n        )\n        \n        self.layer5 = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Conv2d(num_filters, classes, kernel_size=3, padding='same'),\n            nn.LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.01)\n        )\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.layer1(x)\n        x = self.layer2(x)\n        x = self.layer3(x)\n        x = self.layer4(x)\n        x = self.layer5(x)\n        return x\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`nn.Conv2d`**: This is used to create 2D convolutional layers. The `kernel_size=3` specifies a 3x3 filter, and `padding='same'` ensures the output size is the same as the input size.\n\n- **`nn.LeakyReLU`**: This is used as the activation function with a negative slope of 0.01, which allows a small, non-zero gradient when the unit is not active.\n\n- **`nn.Sequential`**: This is used to combine the convolutional layer and the activation function into a single layer block.\n\n- **`forward` Method**: This method defines the forward pass of the network, applying each layer sequentially to the input `x`.\n\nThis setup creates a simple 5-layer fully convolutional network with leaky ReLU activations and 'same' padding, suitable for tasks like semantic segmentation.",
