    "result": "To implement the `forward` method for the `FCN` class, we need to pass the input tensor through the network's layers sequentially. The network consists of a backbone of 5 convolutional layers with Leaky ReLU activations, followed by a final convolutional layer that reduces the number of channels to the desired number of classes. Here's how you can implement the `forward` method:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import nn, Tensor\n\nclass FCN(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, in_channels: int, classes: int, num_filters: int = 64) -> None:\n        super().__init__()\n\n        conv1 = nn.Conv2d(\n            in_channels, num_filters, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1\n        )\n        conv2 = nn.Conv2d(\n            num_filters, num_filters, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1\n        )\n        conv3 = nn.Conv2d(\n            num_filters, num_filters, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1\n        )\n        conv4 = nn.Conv2d(\n            num_filters, num_filters, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1\n        )\n        conv5 = nn.Conv2d(\n            num_filters, num_filters, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1\n        )\n\n        self.backbone = nn.Sequential(\n            conv1,\n            nn.LeakyReLU(inplace=True),\n            conv2,\n            nn.LeakyReLU(inplace=True),\n            conv3,\n            nn.LeakyReLU(inplace=True),\n            conv4,\n            nn.LeakyReLU(inplace=True),\n            conv5,\n            nn.LeakyReLU(inplace=True),\n        )\n\n        self.last = nn.Conv2d(\n            num_filters, classes, kernel_size=1, stride=1, padding=0\n        )\n\n    def forward(self, x: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # Pass the input through the backbone\n        x = self.backbone(x)\n        # Pass the result through the final convolutional layer\n        x = self.last(x)\n        return x\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Backbone**: The `backbone` is a sequence of 5 convolutional layers, each followed by a Leaky ReLU activation. The `nn.Sequential` container is used to stack these layers together, allowing for a clean and concise forward pass.\n\n2. **Final Layer**: The `last` layer is a 1x1 convolution that reduces the number of channels from `num_filters` to `classes`. This layer is responsible for producing the final output with the desired number of classes.\n\n3. **Forward Method**: The `forward` method takes an input tensor `x`, passes it through the `backbone`, and then through the `last` layer. The output is a tensor of shape `[N, classes, H, W]`, where `N` is the batch size, `classes` is the number of output classes, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input tensor, respectively.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input tensor has the shape `[N, C, H, W]`, where `N` is the batch size, `C` is the number of input channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image. The use of 'same' padding ensures that the spatial dimensions of the input are preserved throughout the network.",
