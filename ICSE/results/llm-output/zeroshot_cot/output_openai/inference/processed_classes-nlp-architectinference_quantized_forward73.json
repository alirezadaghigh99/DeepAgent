    "result": "To implement the `inference_quantized_forward` function for the `QuantizedLinear` class, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Quantize the Input**: Convert the input tensor to a quantized format using the specified number of bits.\n2. **Perform the Linear Operation**: Use the quantized weights and biases to perform the linear operation.\n3. **Dequantize the Output**: Convert the result back to a floating-point format.\n4. **Requantize the Output (if enabled)**: Optionally, quantize and then dequantize the output again if `requantize_output` is set to `True`.\n5. **Ensure Inference Mode**: Assert that the function is only used during inference and not during training.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass QuantizedLayer:\n    # Placeholder for the base class\n    pass\n\nclass QuantizedLinear(QuantizedLayer, nn.Linear):\n    def __init__(self, *args, activation_bits=8, requantize_output=True, ema_decay=0.9999, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        self.activation_bits = activation_bits\n        self.accumulation_bits = 32\n        self.ema_decay = ema_decay\n        self.requantize_output = requantize_output\n        self.register_buffer(\"input_thresh\", torch.zeros(1))\n        if self.requantize_output:\n            self.register_buffer(\"output_thresh\", torch.zeros(1))\n\n    def quantize(self, tensor, bits, threshold):\n        scale = (2 ** bits - 1) / threshold\n        return torch.round(tensor * scale)\n\n    def dequantize(self, tensor, bits, threshold):\n        scale = threshold / (2 ** bits - 1)\n        return tensor * scale\n\n    def inference_quantized_forward(self, input):\n        # Ensure this is only used in inference mode\n        assert not self.training, \"inference_quantized_forward should only be used in inference mode.\"\n\n        # Quantize the input\n        input_quantized = self.quantize(input, self.activation_bits, self.input_thresh)\n\n        # Quantize weights and biases\n        weight_quantized = self.quantize(self.weight, self.activation_bits, self.input_thresh)\n        if self.bias is not None:\n            bias_quantized = self.quantize(self.bias, self.activation_bits, self.input_thresh)\n        else:\n            bias_quantized = None\n\n        # Perform the linear operation with quantized values\n        output_quantized = torch.nn.functional.linear(input_quantized, weight_quantized, bias_quantized)\n\n        # Dequantize the output\n        output = self.dequantize(output_quantized, self.accumulation_bits, self.input_thresh)\n\n        # Requantize the output if required\n        if self.requantize_output:\n            output_quantized = self.quantize(output, self.activation_bits, self.output_thresh)\n            output = self.dequantize(output_quantized, self.activation_bits, self.output_thresh)\n\n        return output\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Quantization and Dequantization**: The `quantize` and `dequantize` methods convert tensors to and from a quantized format using a specified number of bits and a threshold.\n- **Linear Operation**: The `torch.nn.functional.linear` function is used to perform the linear operation with quantized weights and biases.\n- **Requantization**: If `requantize_output` is `True`, the output is quantized and dequantized again to simulate the behavior of quantized operations.\n- **Inference Mode Assertion**: The function asserts that it should only be used in inference mode by checking `self.training`.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the thresholds (`input_thresh` and `output_thresh`) are set appropriately for quantization and dequantization. Adjustments may be needed based on the specific quantization strategy and data range.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `inference_quantized_forward` for the class `QuantizedLinear` that simulates a quantized inference forward pass.
