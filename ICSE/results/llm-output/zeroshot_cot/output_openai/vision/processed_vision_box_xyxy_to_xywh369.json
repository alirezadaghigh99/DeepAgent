    "result": "To create a Python function that converts bounding boxes from the (x1, y1, x2, y2) format to the (x, y, w, h) format, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: We'll use PyTorch for tensor operations, so we need to import it.\n2. **Define the Function**: We'll define a function named `_box_xyxy_to_xywh`.\n3. **Calculate the Width and Height**: The width (`w`) is calculated as `x2 - x1`, and the height (`h`) is calculated as `y2 - y1`.\n4. **Return the Converted Tensor**: We'll return a tensor with the new format.\n\nLet's implement this step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries\n\n```python\nimport torch\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the Function\n\n```python\ndef _box_xyxy_to_xywh(boxes):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert bounding boxes from (x1, y1, x2, y2) format to (x, y, w, h) format.\n\n    Args:\n        boxes (Tensor): A tensor of shape (N, 4) where N is the number of boxes,\n                        and each box is represented as (x1, y1, x2, y2).\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor: A tensor of shape (N, 4) where each box is represented as (x, y, w, h).\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Width and Height\n\n```python\n    x1, y1, x2, y2 = boxes.unbind(-1)\n    w = x2 - x1\n    h = y2 - y1\n```\n\n### Step 4: Return the Converted Tensor\n\n```python\n    return torch.stack((x1, y1, w, h), dim=-1)\n```\n\n### Complete Function\n\nHere's the complete function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _box_xyxy_to_xywh(boxes):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert bounding boxes from (x1, y1, x2, y2) format to (x, y, w, h) format.\n\n    Args:\n        boxes (Tensor): A tensor of shape (N, 4) where N is the number of boxes,\n                        and each box is represented as (x1, y1, x2, y2).\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor: A tensor of shape (N, 4) where each box is represented as (x, y, w, h).\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1, x2, y2 = boxes.unbind(-1)\n    w = x2 - x1\n    h = y2 - y1\n    return torch.stack((x1, y1, w, h), dim=-1)\n```\n\nThis function takes a tensor of bounding boxes in the (x1, y1, x2, y2) format and returns a tensor in the (x, y, w, h) format. The function assumes that the input tensor has a shape of (N, 4), where N is the number of bounding boxes.",
