    "result": "To implement the `sigmoid_focal_loss` function, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: We'll use PyTorch for tensor operations.\n2. **Define the Sigmoid Focal Loss Formula**: The focal loss is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{FL}(p_t) = -\\alpha_t (1 - p_t)^\\gamma \\log(p_t)\n   \\]\n   where \\( p_t \\) is the model's estimated probability for each class, adjusted for the target class.\n3. **Implement the Function**: We'll implement the function to compute the focal loss using the formula above.\n4. **Handle Reduction Options**: We'll add logic to handle different reduction options: 'none', 'mean', and 'sum'.\n\nLet's implement the function step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the Sigmoid Focal Loss Formula\n\nThe focal loss is computed using the sigmoid of the inputs to get probabilities, and then applying the focal loss formula.\n\n### Step 3: Implement the Function\n\n```python\ndef sigmoid_focal_loss(inputs, targets, alpha=0.25, gamma=2.0, reduction='none'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the sigmoid focal loss between `inputs` and the ground truth `targets`.\n    \n    Args:\n        inputs (Tensor): Predictions for each example.\n        targets (Tensor): Ground truth binary labels (0 or 1) for each example.\n        alpha (float): Weighting factor for the positive class.\n        gamma (float): Focusing parameter to reduce the loss for well-classified examples.\n        reduction (str): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output: 'none' | 'mean' | 'sum'.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Tensor: Loss tensor with the specified reduction applied.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Apply sigmoid to get probabilities\n    probs = torch.sigmoid(inputs)\n    \n    # Compute the focal loss components\n    ce_loss = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(inputs, targets, reduction='none')\n    p_t = probs * targets + (1 - probs) * (1 - targets)\n    focal_weight = (alpha * targets + (1 - alpha) * (1 - targets)) * (1 - p_t) ** gamma\n    \n    # Compute the focal loss\n    loss = focal_weight * ce_loss\n    \n    # Apply reduction\n    if reduction == 'mean':\n        return loss.mean()\n    elif reduction == 'sum':\n        return loss.sum()\n    else:  # 'none'\n        return loss\n```\n\n### Step 4: Handle Reduction Options\n\nThe function already includes logic to handle the 'none', 'mean', and 'sum' reduction options.\n\nThis function should now correctly compute the sigmoid focal loss for a given set of predictions and targets, with the specified alpha, gamma, and reduction options.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called sigmoid_focal_loss that calculates the focal loss used in RetinaNet for dense detection. The function takes in four parameters: inputs (a float tensor of arbitrary shape representing predictions), targets (a float tensor with the same shape as inputs representing binary classification labels), alpha (a float weighting factor to balance positive vs negative examples), gamma (a float exponent to balance easy vs hard examples), and reduction (a string specifying the reduction option for the output). The function returns a loss tensor with the specified reduction option applied. The function implements the focal loss formula and handles different reduction options such as 'none', 'mean', or 'sum'.",
