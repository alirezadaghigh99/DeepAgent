    "result": "To implement the `normalize` method for the `GeneralizedRCNNTransform` class, we need to ensure that the input image is of a floating-point type and then apply normalization using the provided mean and standard deviation.

If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n- **Mean and Std Conversion**: The mean and standard deviation lists are converted to tensors and moved to the same device as the input image.\n- **Broadcasting**: The mean and standard deviation tensors are reshaped to ensure they can be broadcasted across the image dimensions.\n- **Normalization**: The image is normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.\n\nThis method assumes that the input image is a tensor with shape `(C, H, W)`, where `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the image, respectively.",
