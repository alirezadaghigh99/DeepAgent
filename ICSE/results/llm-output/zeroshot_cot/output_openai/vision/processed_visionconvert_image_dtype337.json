    "result": "To create the `convert_image_dtype` function, we need to handle the conversion of a tensor image to a specified data type (`dtype`) while scaling the values appropriately. We'll also need to handle potential errors when converting between certain data types, as mentioned in the note and the raises section.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Check for Unsupported Conversions**: We need to raise a `RuntimeError` for specific conversions that might lead to overflow errors.\n\n2. **Determine Scaling Factors**: When converting between different data types, especially between integer and floating-point types, we need to scale the values appropriately. For example, converting from `uint8` to `float32` typically involves dividing by 255.\n\n3. **Perform the Conversion**: Use PyTorch's built-in functions to convert the tensor to the desired data type.\n\n4. **Return the Converted Tensor**: After conversion, return the resulting tensor.\n\nHere's the step-by-step implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef convert_image_dtype(image: torch.Tensor, dtype: torch.dtype) -> torch.Tensor:\n    # Check for unsupported conversions\n    if (image.dtype == torch.float32 and dtype in [torch.int32, torch.int64]) or \\\n       (image.dtype == torch.float64 and dtype == torch.int64):\n        raise RuntimeError(f\"Conversion from {image.dtype} to {dtype} is not supported due to potential overflow.\")\n\n    # Determine scaling factors\n    if torch.is_floating_point(image):\n        # Converting from float to integer\n        if dtype.is_floating_point:\n            # Float to float conversion\n            return image.to(dtype)\n        else:\n            # Float to int conversion\n            max_val = torch.iinfo(dtype).max\n            return (image * max_val).to(dtype)\n    else:\n        # Converting from int to float\n        if dtype.is_floating_point:\n            max_val = torch.iinfo(image.dtype).max\n            return (image.to(dtype) / max_val)\n        else:\n            # Int to int conversion\n            return image.to(dtype)\n\n# Example usage:\n# image = torch.randint(0, 256, (3, 256, 256), dtype=torch.uint8)\n# converted_image = convert_image_dtype(image, torch.float32)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Unsupported Conversions**: We raise a `RuntimeError` for conversions from `torch.float32` to `torch.int32` or `torch.int64`, and from `torch.float64` to `torch.int64`.\n\n- **Scaling Factors**: \n  - When converting from a floating-point to an integer, we scale by the maximum value of the target integer type.\n  - When converting from an integer to a floating-point, we divide by the maximum value of the source integer type.\n\n- **Conversion**: We use `torch.to(dtype)` to convert the tensor to the desired data type after scaling.\n\nThis function should handle most common conversions between image data types in PyTorch.",
