    "result": "To generate the `box_area` function step by step, we'll break down the process into smaller parts. We'll use the PyTorch library to handle tensor operations. Here's how we can proceed:\n\n### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries\n\nFirst, we need to import the PyTorch library, which will allow us to work with tensors.\n\n```python\nimport torch\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the Function Signature\n\nWe'll define the function `box_area` that takes a tensor `boxes` as input.\n\n```python\ndef box_area(boxes: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n```\n\n### Step 3: Extract Coordinates\n\nThe input tensor `boxes` has a shape of `(N, 4)`, where each row represents a bounding box in the format `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`. We need to extract these coordinates.\n\n```python\n    x1 = boxes[:, 0]\n    y1 = boxes[:, 1]\n    x2 = boxes[:, 2]\n    y2 = boxes[:, 3]\n```\n\n### Step 4: Compute Width and Height\n\nFor each bounding box, compute the width and height using the coordinates.\n\n```python\n    width = x2 - x1\n    height = y2 - y1\n```\n\n### Step 5: Compute the Area\n\nThe area of each bounding box can be calculated as the product of its width and height.\n\n```python\n    area = width * height\n```\n\n### Step 6: Return the Result\n\nFinally, return the computed areas as a tensor.\n\n```python\n    return area\n```\n\n### Complete Function\n\nCombining all the steps, the complete function looks like this:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef box_area(boxes: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    x1 = boxes[:, 0]\n    y1 = boxes[:, 1]\n    x2 = boxes[:, 2]\n    y2 = boxes[:, 3]\n    \n    width = x2 - x1\n    height = y2 - y1\n    \n    area = width * height\n    \n    return area\n```\n\nThis function will compute the area for each bounding box in the input tensor and return a tensor containing these areas.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called box_area that computes the area of a set of bounding boxes specified by their (x1, y1, x2, y2) coordinates. The input is a tensor of shape (N, 4) called boxes, where N is the number of boxes. The boxes are expected to be in (x1, y1, x2, y2) format with 0 <= x1 < x2 and 0 <= y1 < y2. The function returns a tensor of shape (N) containing the area for each box.",
