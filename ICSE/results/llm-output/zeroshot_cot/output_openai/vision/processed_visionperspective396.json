    "result": "To create the `perspective` function, we'll break down the task into several steps. We'll start by defining the helper function `_get_perspective_coeffs` to compute the transformation coefficients. Then, we'll implement the main `perspective` function, which will handle both PIL Images and PyTorch Tensors. We'll also include error handling and parameter validation.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Helper Function `_get_perspective_coeffs`\n\nThis function will calculate the coefficients needed for the perspective transformation.\n\n```python\ndef _get_perspective_coeffs(startpoints, endpoints):\n    \"\"\"Calculate coefficients for perspective transformation.\"\"\"\n    matrix = []\n    for p1, p2 in zip(startpoints, endpoints):\n        matrix.append([p1[0], p1[1], 1, 0, 0, 0, -p2[0] * p1[0], -p2[0] * p1[1]])\n        matrix.append([0, 0, 0, p1[0], p1[1], 1, -p2[1] * p1[0], -p2[1] * p1[1]])\n\n    A = np.array(matrix, dtype=np.float)\n    B = np.array(endpoints).reshape(8)\n\n    res = np.linalg.solve(A, B)\n    return res.reshape(8)\n```\n\n### Step 2: Implement the `perspective` Function\n\nThis function will handle the input image, validate parameters, and apply the transformation.\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport numpy as np\nimport torch\nimport torchvision.transforms.functional as F\n\ndef perspective(image, startpoints, endpoints, interpolation=Image.BILINEAR, fill=None):\n    \"\"\"Apply a perspective transformation to an image.\"\"\"\n    # Validate input points\n    if len(startpoints) != 4 or len(endpoints) != 4:\n        raise ValueError(\"startpoints and endpoints must each contain exactly four points.\")\n\n    # Calculate perspective coefficients\n    coeffs = _get_perspective_coeffs(startpoints, endpoints)\n\n    if isinstance(image, Image.Image):\n        # Handle PIL Image\n        return image.transform(image.size, Image.PERSPECTIVE, coeffs, interpolation, fillcolor=fill)\n    elif isinstance(image, torch.Tensor):\n        # Handle PyTorch Tensor\n        if image.ndimension() != 3:\n            raise ValueError(\"Input tensor must be a 3D tensor.\")\n        \n        # Convert tensor to PIL Image\n        pil_image = F.to_pil_image(image)\n        transformed_image = pil_image.transform(pil_image.size, Image.PERSPECTIVE, coeffs, interpolation, fillcolor=fill)\n        \n        # Convert back to tensor\n        return F.to_tensor(transformed_image)\n    else:\n        raise TypeError(\"Input image must be a PIL Image or a PyTorch Tensor.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **_get_perspective_coeffs**: Computes the transformation matrix coefficients using linear algebra to solve the system of equations derived from the start and end points.\n- **perspective**: \n  - Validates that exactly four corner points are provided for both `startpoints` and `endpoints`.\n  - Computes the transformation coefficients using `_get_perspective_coeffs`.\n  - Applies the transformation using PIL's `transform` method if the input is a PIL Image.\n  - Converts a PyTorch Tensor to a PIL Image, applies the transformation, and converts it back to a Tensor if the input is a Tensor.\n  - Raises appropriate exceptions for invalid inputs.\n\nThis function should now be able to perform perspective transformations on both PIL Images and PyTorch Tensors, with error handling and parameter validation.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called perspective that performs a perspective transformation on an image. The function should accept an image input, which can be either a PIL Image or a PyTorch Tensor, along with startpoints and endpoints, each consisting of four coordinate pairs representing the corners of the original and transformed images, respectively. It should include an interpolation parameter to specify how pixel values are calculated during the transformation, defaulting to BILINEAR. Additionally, an optional fill parameter should be provided to determine the pixel values for areas outside the transformed image. The function should handle errors gracefully, such as ensuring exactly four corner points are provided for both startpoints and endpoints, and raise appropriate exceptions for invalid inputs. The function should utilize underlying helper functions like _get_perspective_coeffs to compute the necessary transformation coefficients and apply the transformation using appropriate methods based on the input type, returning the transformed image as a PIL Image or Tensor.",
