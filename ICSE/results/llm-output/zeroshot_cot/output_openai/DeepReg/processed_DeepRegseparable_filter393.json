    "result": "To implement a 3D separable filter using TensorFlow, we need to apply 1D convolutions along each dimension separately. The idea is to convolve the input tensor with the kernel along each axis (depth, height, and width) independently. Here's how you can implement the `separable_filter` function:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ndef separable_filter(tensor: tf.Tensor, kernel: tf.Tensor) -> tf.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a 3d separable filter.\n\n    :param tensor: shape = (batch, dim1, dim2, dim3, 1)\n    :param kernel: shape = (dim4,)\n    :return: shape = (batch, dim1, dim2, dim3, 1)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure the kernel is a 1D tensor\n    kernel = tf.reshape(kernel, [-1, 1, 1, 1, 1])\n\n    # Convolve along the depth dimension\n    depth_conv = tf.nn.conv3d(tensor, kernel, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')\n\n    # Transpose to bring the height dimension to the depth position\n    height_transposed = tf.transpose(depth_conv, perm=[0, 2, 3, 1, 4])\n\n    # Convolve along the height dimension\n    height_conv = tf.nn.conv3d(height_transposed, kernel, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')\n\n    # Transpose to bring the width dimension to the depth position\n    width_transposed = tf.transpose(height_conv, perm=[0, 3, 1, 2, 4])\n\n    # Convolve along the width dimension\n    width_conv = tf.nn.conv3d(width_transposed, kernel, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')\n\n    # Transpose back to the original order\n    result = tf.transpose(width_conv, perm=[0, 2, 3, 1, 4])\n\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Kernel Reshaping**: The kernel is reshaped to a 5D tensor with shape `(filter_depth, filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels)`. Since we are applying 1D convolutions, the kernel is reshaped to have a single non-trivial dimension.\n\n2. **Depth Convolution**: The first convolution is applied along the depth dimension of the input tensor.\n\n3. **Height Convolution**: The tensor is transposed to bring the height dimension to the depth position, and then a convolution is applied.\n\n4. **Width Convolution**: Similarly, the tensor is transposed to bring the width dimension to the depth position, and a convolution is applied.\n\n5. **Final Transpose**: The tensor is transposed back to its original order.\n\nThis approach effectively applies a separable filter by convolving along each dimension independently.",
