    "result": "To create a 1D triangular kernel, we need to generate a sequence of values that increase linearly to a peak and then decrease linearly. Given that the kernel size is odd, the peak will be at the center of the kernel. Here's how you can implement the `triangular_kernel1d` function in TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ndef triangular_kernel1d(kernel_size: int) -> tf.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a the 1D triangular kernel for LocalNormalizedCrossCorrelation.\n\n    Assume kernel_size is odd, it will be a smoothed from\n    a kernel which center part is zero.\n    Then length of the ones will be around half kernel_size.\n    The weight scale of the kernel does not matter as LNCC will normalize it.\n\n    :param kernel_size: scalar, size of the 1-D kernel\n    :return: kernel_weights, of shape (kernel_size, )\n    \"\"\"\n    assert kernel_size >= 3\n    assert kernel_size % 2 != 0\n\n    # Calculate the half size of the kernel\n    half_size = kernel_size // 2\n\n    # Create a linearly increasing sequence from 1 to half_size + 1\n    increasing = tf.range(1, half_size + 2, dtype=tf.float32)\n\n    # Create a linearly decreasing sequence from half_size to 1\n    decreasing = tf.range(half_size, 0, -1, dtype=tf.float32)\n\n    # Concatenate the increasing and decreasing sequences\n    kernel_weights = tf.concat([increasing, decreasing], axis=0)\n\n    return kernel_weights\n\n# Example usage\nkernel_size = 5\nkernel = triangular_kernel1d(kernel_size)\nprint(kernel.numpy())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Assertions**: We first assert that the `kernel_size` is at least 3 and is odd.\n2. **Half Size Calculation**: We calculate `half_size` as `kernel_size // 2`. This helps in determining the peak of the triangular kernel.\n3. **Increasing Sequence**: We create a sequence that increases linearly from 1 to `half_size + 1`.\n4. **Decreasing Sequence**: We create a sequence that decreases linearly from `half_size` to 1.\n5. **Concatenation**: We concatenate the increasing and decreasing sequences to form the triangular kernel.\n6. **Return**: The function returns the kernel as a TensorFlow tensor.\n\nThis function will generate a symmetric triangular kernel centered around the middle of the kernel size.",
