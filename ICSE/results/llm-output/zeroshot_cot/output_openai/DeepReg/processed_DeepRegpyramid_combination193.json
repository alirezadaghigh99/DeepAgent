    "result": "To create the `pyramid_combination` function, we need to perform linear interpolation in an n-dimensional space using the values at the corners of a hypercube. Here's how we can break down the task:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: Ensure that the inputs are compatible. Specifically, the length of `values` should be `2^n`, where `n` is the length of `weight_floor` and `weight_ceil`.\n\n2. **Interpolation Logic**: Use the weights to perform linear interpolation. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of the weights to compute the interpolated value.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Raise a `ValueError` if the inputs do not meet the required conditions.\n\nLet's implement this step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Input Validation\n\nFirst, we need to check that the length of `values` is `2^n`, where `n` is the length of `weight_floor` and `weight_ceil`.\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef pyramid_combination(values, weight_floor, weight_ceil):\n    # Check that weight_floor and weight_ceil have the same length\n    if len(weight_floor) != len(weight_ceil):\n        raise ValueError(\"weight_floor and weight_ceil must have the same length.\")\n    \n    # Calculate the expected number of values\n    n = len(weight_floor)\n    expected_values_length = 2 ** n\n    \n    # Check that the length of values is 2^n\n    if len(values) != expected_values_length:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Length of values must be {expected_values_length}, but got {len(values)}.\")\n```\n\n### Step 2: Interpolation Logic\n\nWe need to iterate over all possible combinations of the weights. For each combination, we compute the product of the weights and sum the contributions from each corner.\n\n```python\n    # Initialize the result tensor with zeros, having the same shape as the first value tensor\n    result = torch.zeros_like(values[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over all possible combinations of weights\n    for i in range(expected_values_length):\n        # Determine the binary representation of i\n        binary_index = [(i >> j) & 1 for j in range(n)]\n        \n        # Calculate the weight for this combination\n        weight = torch.ones_like(result)\n        for j in range(n):\n            if binary_index[j] == 0:\n                weight *= weight_floor[j]\n            else:\n                weight *= weight_ceil[j]\n        \n        # Add the contribution of this corner to the result\n        result += weight * values[i]\n    \n    return result\n```\n\n### Step 3: Error Handling\n\nWe've already included error handling in the input validation step. If the conditions are not met, a `ValueError` is raised.\n\n### Complete Function\n\nHere's the complete `pyramid_combination` function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef pyramid_combination(values, weight_floor, weight_ceil):\n    # Check that weight_floor and weight_ceil have the same length\n    if len(weight_floor) != len(weight_ceil):\n        raise ValueError(\"weight_floor and weight_ceil must have the same length.\")\n    \n    # Calculate the expected number of values\n    n = len(weight_floor)\n    expected_values_length = 2 ** n\n    \n    # Check that the length of values is 2^n\n    if len(values) != expected_values_length:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Length of values must be {expected_values_length}, but got {len(values)}.\")\n    \n    # Initialize the result tensor with zeros, having the same shape as the first value tensor\n    result = torch.zeros_like(values[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over all possible combinations of weights\n    for i in range(expected_values_length):\n        # Determine the binary representation of i\n        binary_index = [(i >> j) & 1 for j in range(n)]\n        \n        # Calculate the weight for this combination\n        weight = torch.ones_like(result)\n        for j in range(n):\n            if binary_index[j] == 0:\n                weight *= weight_floor[j]\n            else:\n                weight *= weight_ceil[j]\n        \n        # Add the contribution of this corner to the result\n        result += weight * values[i]\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis function should now correctly perform linear interpolation in an n-dimensional space based on the values at the corners of a hypercube.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `pyramid_combination` that performs linear interpolation based on values at the corners of a hypercube in an n-dimensional space. The function accepts three main inputs: `values` (a list of tensors representing values at the corners), `weight_floor`, and `weight_ceil` (lists of tensors representing the interpolation weights). The function ensures that the shapes of the inputs are compatible, with `values` needing to have a length of `2^n` where `n` is the length of `weight_floor` and `weight_ceil`. It returns a tensor with the same shape as the elements in `values`.\n\nThe function includes error handling to check for mismatched dimensions between `values`, `weight_floor`, and `weight_ceil`, and also validates that the length of `values` matches the expected `2^n` based on the dimension of the weights. If these conditions are not met, the function raises a `ValueError`.",
