    "result": "To implement the `multinomial_sampling` function for the `RBM` class, we need to perform multinomial sampling using a rejection method. The function will take a tensor `pr` of shape `(m, n, r)` as input, where `m` is the number of examples, `n` is the number of features, and `r` is the number of classes (ratings). The goal is to return a tensor of shape `(m, n)` where each element is the index of the maximum value in the sampled tensor.\n\nHere's how we can implement this step by step:\n\n1. **Import TensorFlow**: Ensure that TensorFlow is imported since we'll be using it for tensor operations.\n\n2. **Define the Function**: The function will be a method of the `RBM` class and will take `pr` as an input.\n\n3. **Sample from the Distribution**: Use TensorFlow operations to sample from the multinomial distribution defined by `pr`.\n\n4. **Find the Index of the Maximum Value**: For each `(m, n)` pair, find the index of the maximum value in the sampled tensor along the last dimension (which corresponds to the classes).\n\n5. **Return the Result**: Return the resulting tensor of indices.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nclass RBM:\n    def __init__(self, possible_ratings, visible_units, hidden_units=500, keep_prob=0.7, init_stdv=0.1, learning_rate=0.004, minibatch_size=100, training_epoch=20, display_epoch=10, sampling_protocol=[50, 70, 80, 90, 100], debug=False, with_metrics=False, seed=42):\n        pass\n\n    def multinomial_sampling(self, pr):\n        # Ensure the input is a TensorFlow tensor\n        pr = tf.convert_to_tensor(pr, dtype=tf.float32)\n        \n        # Get the shape of the input tensor\n        m, n, r = pr.shape\n        \n        # Sample from the multinomial distribution\n        # We use the Gumbel-max trick for sampling\n        gumbel_noise = -tf.math.log(-tf.math.log(tf.random.uniform(tf.shape(pr), 0, 1)))\n        sampled = tf.argmax(pr + gumbel_noise, axis=-1)\n        \n        return sampled\n\n# Example usage:\n# rbm = RBM(possible_ratings=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], visible_units=10)\n# pr = tf.random.uniform((5, 10, 5))  # Example tensor with shape (5, 10, 5)\n# sampled_ratings = rbm.multinomial_sampling(pr)\n# print(sampled_ratings)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Gumbel-max Trick**: This is a method to sample from a categorical distribution. By adding Gumbel noise to the logits and taking the `argmax`, we effectively sample from the distribution.\n- **TensorFlow Operations**: We use TensorFlow operations to ensure compatibility with TensorFlow's computation graph, which is important for models that will be trained using TensorFlow.\n\nThis implementation should work efficiently for the given task, leveraging TensorFlow's capabilities for handling tensor operations.",
