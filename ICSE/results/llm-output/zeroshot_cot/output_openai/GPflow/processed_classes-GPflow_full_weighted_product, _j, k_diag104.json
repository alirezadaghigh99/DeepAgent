    "result": "To generate the `_full_weighted_product` function, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Inputs and Outputs**: The function takes two inputs, `X` and `X2`. If `X2` is `None`, the function should compute the weighted product of `X` with itself. The output is a tensor representing the weighted product.\n\n2. **Attributes**: The function uses `weight_variances` and `bias_variance` attributes. These are likely parameters of the `ArcCosine` class that influence the computation.\n\n3. **Tensor Operations**: The function will involve tensor operations, likely using TensorFlow, given the type hint `tf.Tensor`.\n\n4. **Handling `X2`**: If `X2` is `None`, the function should handle this case by using `X` for both inputs in the computation.\n\nLet's write the function step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries\n\nFirst, ensure that TensorFlow is imported since we will be working with tensors.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the Function\n\nDefine the function `_full_weighted_product` within the `ArcCosine` class.\n\n```python\nclass ArcCosine(Kernel):\n    def _full_weighted_product(self, X: tf.Tensor, X2: Optional[tf.Tensor] = None) -> tf.Tensor:\n```\n\n### Step 3: Handle the `X2` Parameter\n\nCheck if `X2` is `None` and set it to `X` if so.\n\n```python\n        if X2 is None:\n            X2 = X\n```\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Weighted Product\n\nUse the `weight_variances` and `bias_variance` attributes to compute the weighted product. Assuming `weight_variances` is a tensor that can be broadcasted with `X` and `X2`, and `bias_variance` is a scalar:\n\n```python\n        # Assuming weight_variances is a 1D tensor of shape [D] where D is the feature dimension\n        weighted_X = X * self.weight_variances\n        weighted_X2 = X2 * self.weight_variances\n        \n        # Compute the dot product and add the bias variance\n        product = tf.matmul(weighted_X, weighted_X2, transpose_b=True) + self.bias_variance\n```\n\n### Step 5: Return the Result\n\nReturn the computed weighted product.\n\n```python\n        return product\n```\n\n### Full Function Code\n\nHere is the complete function:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass ArcCosine(Kernel):\n    def _full_weighted_product(self, X: tf.Tensor, X2: Optional[tf.Tensor] = None) -> tf.Tensor:\n        if X2 is None:\n            X2 = X\n        \n        # Assuming weight_variances is a 1D tensor of shape [D] where D is the feature dimension\n        weighted_X = X * self.weight_variances\n        weighted_X2 = X2 * self.weight_variances\n        \n        # Compute the dot product and add the bias variance\n        product = tf.matmul(weighted_X, weighted_X2, transpose_b=True) + self.bias_variance\n        \n        return product\n```\n\nThis function assumes that `weight_variances` is a tensor that can be broadcasted with the input tensors `X` and `X2`, and that `bias_variance` is a scalar value. Adjustments may be needed based on the actual shapes and types of these attributes.",
