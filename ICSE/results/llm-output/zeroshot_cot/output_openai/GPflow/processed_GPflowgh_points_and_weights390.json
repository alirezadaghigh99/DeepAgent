    "result": "To complete the function `gh_points_and_weights`, we need to generate Gauss-Hermite quadrature points and weights. These are used for approximating integrals of the form given in the docstring. The Gauss-Hermite quadrature is particularly useful for integrals involving the weight function \\( e^{-x^2} \\), which is related to the normal distribution.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function using TensorFlow:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: We need TensorFlow for tensor operations and potentially NumPy for generating the Gauss-Hermite points and weights.\n\n2. **Generate Gauss-Hermite Points and Weights**: We can use a numerical library like NumPy to generate these points and weights. TensorFlow does not have a built-in function for Gauss-Hermite quadrature, so we will use NumPy's `numpy.polynomial.hermite.hermgauss` function.\n\n3. **Convert to TensorFlow Tensors**: Since the function is expected to return TensorFlow tensors, we will convert the NumPy arrays to TensorFlow tensors.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\ndef gh_points_and_weights(n_gh: int) -> Tuple[tf.Tensor, tf.Tensor]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Given the number of Gauss-Hermite points n_gh,\n    returns the points z and the weights dz to perform the following\n    uni-dimensional gaussian quadrature:\n\n    X ~ N(mean, stddev\u00b2)\n    E[f(X)] = \u222b f(x) p(x) dx = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_gh} f(mean + stddev*z_i) dz_i\n\n    :param n_gh: Number of Gauss-Hermite points\n    :returns: Points z and weights dz to compute uni-dimensional gaussian expectation\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use numpy to get Gauss-Hermite points and weights\n    z, dz = np.polynomial.hermite.hermgauss(n_gh)\n    \n    # Convert to TensorFlow tensors\n    z_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(z, dtype=tf.float32)\n    dz_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(dz, dtype=tf.float32)\n    \n    return z_tensor, dz_tensor\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`numpy.polynomial.hermite.hermgauss(n_gh)`**: This function returns the roots (points) and weights for the Gauss-Hermite quadrature of order `n_gh`. These are used to approximate the integral of a function multiplied by the weight function \\( e^{-x^2} \\).\n\n- **Conversion to TensorFlow Tensors**: Since the function is expected to return TensorFlow tensors, we convert the NumPy arrays to TensorFlow tensors using `tf.convert_to_tensor`.\n\nThis function will now return the Gauss-Hermite points and weights as TensorFlow tensors, which can be used in further computations involving TensorFlow operations.",
