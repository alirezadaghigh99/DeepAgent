    "result": "To complete the `reshape_Z_dZ` function, we need to transform the input sequences of tensors `zs` and `dzs` into two specific tensors: `Z` and `dZ`. The tensor `Z` should have a shape of `[N1*N2*...*Nd, D]`, where `D` is the number of tensors in `zs`, and `dZ` should have a shape of `[N1*N2*...*Nd, 1]`. Here's how you can achieve this step by step:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: Ensure you have TensorFlow imported since the function is expected to return TensorFlow tensors.\n\n2. **Flatten and Meshgrid**: Use `tf.meshgrid` to create a grid of all combinations of the input tensors. This will help in reshaping the tensors to the desired format.\n\n3. **Reshape and Stack**: Reshape the grid to the required shape and stack them to form the `Z` tensor.\n\n4. **Compute dZ**: Compute the product of all elements in `dzs` to form the `dZ` tensor.\n\nHere's the complete function:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom typing import Sequence, Tuple\n\ndef reshape_Z_dZ(\n    zs: Sequence[tf.Tensor], dzs: Sequence[tf.Tensor]\n) -> Tuple[tf.Tensor, tf.Tensor]:\n    # Step 1: Create a meshgrid from the input tensors\n    meshgrid = tf.meshgrid(*zs, indexing='ij')\n    \n    # Step 2: Flatten each grid to create a list of flattened tensors\n    flattened_grids = [tf.reshape(grid, [-1]) for grid in meshgrid]\n    \n    # Step 3: Stack the flattened grids along the last dimension to form Z\n    Z = tf.stack(flattened_grids, axis=-1)\n    \n    # Step 4: Compute the product of all elements in dzs to form dZ\n    dZ_product = tf.reduce_prod(tf.stack(dzs))\n    \n    # Step 5: Create dZ tensor with the same number of rows as Z and 1 column\n    dZ = tf.fill([tf.shape(Z)[0], 1], dZ_product)\n    \n    return Z, dZ\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Meshgrid**: `tf.meshgrid` is used to generate a grid of all possible combinations of the input tensors. The `indexing='ij'` argument ensures that the grid is created in a way that matches the input dimensions.\n- **Flattening**: Each grid is flattened to a 1D tensor, which allows us to stack them into a 2D tensor.\n- **Stacking**: The flattened grids are stacked along the last dimension to form the `Z` tensor, which has the shape `[N1*N2*...*Nd, D]`.\n- **dZ Calculation**: The product of all elements in `dzs` is computed to form a single scalar value, which is then used to create a tensor `dZ` with the same number of rows as `Z` and a single column.\n\nThis function should work as expected, given that the input tensors `zs` and `dzs` are compatible in terms of their dimensions.",
