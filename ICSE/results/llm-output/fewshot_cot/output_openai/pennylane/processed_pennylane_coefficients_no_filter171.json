    "result": "To create the `_coefficients_no_filter` function as described, we can follow a structured approach similar to the examples provided. The function will compute the Fourier coefficients for a \\(2\\pi\\)-periodic function using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef _coefficients_no_filter(f, degree, use_broadcasting):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the first (2d+1) Fourier coefficients for a 2\u03c0-periodic function.\n\n    Args:\n        f (callable): The 2\u03c0-periodic function to evaluate.\n        degree (int or tuple): The maximum frequency for each dimension.\n        use_broadcasting (bool): Whether to use broadcasting for evaluations.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: Array of complex numbers representing the Fourier coefficients.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Convert degree to a NumPy array for consistent handling\n    degree = np.array(degree, ndmin=1)\n\n    # 2. Determine the number of frequencies to include for each dimension\n    k = 2 * degree + 1  # shape in each dimension\n\n    # 3. Create a list of ranges for each dimension: [-d_i, ..., d_i]\n    n_ranges = [np.arange(-d, d + 1) for d in degree]\n\n    # 4. Prepare to iterate over all combinations (Cartesian product) of the n_ranges\n    #    except possibly the last one if broadcasting is used.\n    nvecs = product(*(n_ranges[:-1] if use_broadcasting else n_ranges))\n\n    # 5. Initialize a NumPy array to hold the discretized function values.\n    #    The shape is determined by k for each dimension.\n    f_discrete = np.zeros(shape=tuple(k), dtype=complex)\n\n    # 6. Compute the spacing for each dimension, used to map indices -> evaluation points\n    spacing = (2 * np.pi) / k\n\n    # 7. Loop over all combinations of indices (nvec) to fill f_discrete\n    for nvec in nvecs:\n        # Handle broadcasting:\n        # if use_broadcasting, append the entire last dimension's n-range as an array.\n        if use_broadcasting:\n            nvec = (*nvec, n_ranges[-1])  # n_ranges[-1] is an array\n            sampling_point = [s * n for s, n in zip(spacing, nvec)]\n        else:\n            sampling_point = spacing * np.array(nvec)\n\n        # Evaluate f at the computed sampling_point and store\n        f_discrete[nvec] = f(sampling_point)\n\n    # 8. Use multi-dimensional FFT to compute Fourier coefficients\n    #    Divide by the total number of points to normalize\n    coeffs = np.fft.fftn(f_discrete) / f_discrete.size\n\n    # 9. Return the raw Fourier coefficients\n    return coeffs\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Degree Handling**: The `degree` is converted to a NumPy array to handle both single and multi-dimensional cases uniformly.\n\n2. **Frequency Ranges**: For each dimension, we create a range of frequencies from \\(-d_i\\) to \\(d_i\\).\n\n3. **Cartesian Product**: We use `itertools.product` to iterate over all combinations of frequency indices, except the last dimension if broadcasting is enabled.\n\n4. **Function Evaluation**: The function `f` is evaluated at each computed sampling point. If broadcasting is used, the last dimension is handled as an array.\n\n5. **FFT Calculation**: The multi-dimensional FFT is applied to the discretized function values to compute the Fourier coefficients, which are then normalized by the total number of points.\n\nThis function efficiently computes the Fourier coefficients for multi-dimensional inputs and can leverage broadcasting for performance optimization.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `_coefficients_no_filter` that computes the first \\(2d+1\\) Fourier coefficients for a \\(2\\pi\\)-periodic function, serving as a helper to compute these coefficients without filtering. The function takes a callable `f`, an integer or tuple `degree` representing the maximum frequency, and a boolean `use_broadcasting` to decide whether to use broadcasting for simultaneous function evaluations. It returns a NumPy array of complex numbers containing the Fourier coefficients up to the specified degree. The function should efficiently handle multi-dimensional inputs and leverage broadcasting for performance optimization.",
