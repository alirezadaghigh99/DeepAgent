    "result": "To create the `extract_tensors` function, we can follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples provided. The function will iterate through an iterable and yield any PennyLane tensors it encounters. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Union, Sequence, Generator\nimport pennylane as qml\n\ndef extract_tensors(x: Union[qml.numpy.tensor, Sequence]) -> Generator[qml.numpy.tensor, None, None]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Iterate through an iterable, and extract any PennyLane tensors that appear.\n\n    Args:\n        x (qml.numpy.tensor or Sequence): an input tensor or sequence\n\n    Yields:\n        qml.numpy.tensor: the next tensor in the sequence. If the input was a single\n        tensor, then the tensor is yielded and the iterator completes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Check if the input is a single PennyLane tensor\n    if isinstance(x, qml.numpy.tensor):\n        # 2. Yield the tensor and complete the iteration\n        yield x\n        return\n\n    # 3. If the input is a sequence, iterate over each element\n    for item in x:\n        # 4. Check if the current item is a PennyLane tensor\n        if isinstance(item, qml.numpy.tensor):\n            # 5. Yield the tensor\n            yield item\n        # 6. If the item is a sequence itself, recursively extract tensors\n        elif isinstance(item, Sequence) and not isinstance(item, str):\n            yield from extract_tensors(item)\n\n# Example usage:\n# tensors = [qml.numpy.tensor([1, 2, 3]), [qml.numpy.tensor([4, 5]), qml.numpy.tensor([6])]]\n# for tensor in extract_tensors(tensors):\n#     print(tensor)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Type Checking**: The function first checks if the input `x` is a single PennyLane tensor using `isinstance(x, qml.numpy.tensor)`. If it is, the tensor is yielded immediately, and the function returns.\n\n2. **Iterating Over Sequences**: If `x` is a sequence, the function iterates over each element. For each element, it checks if it is a PennyLane tensor and yields it if true.\n\n3. **Recursive Extraction**: If an element is itself a sequence (and not a string, to avoid iterating over characters), the function calls itself recursively to extract tensors from nested sequences.\n\nThis approach ensures that all PennyLane tensors within the input, whether directly or nested within sequences, are extracted and yielded.",
