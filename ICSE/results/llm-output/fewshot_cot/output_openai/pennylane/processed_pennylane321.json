Convert tensor1 to a NumPy array if it's a PyTorch tensor\n    if isinstance(tensor1, torch.Tensor):\n        tensor1 = tensor1.numpy()\n\n    # 2. Convert tensor2 to a NumPy array if it's a PyTorch tensor\n    if isinstance(tensor2, torch.Tensor):\n        tensor2 = tensor2.numpy()\n\n    # 3. Use np.all to check if all elements are equal, with support for additional kwargs\n    return np.all(tensor1 == tensor2, **kwargs)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Type Conversion**: The function first checks if `tensor1` and `tensor2` are PyTorch tensors. If they are, it converts them to NumPy arrays using the `.numpy()` method. This ensures that both inputs are in a compatible format for comparison.\n\n2. **Element-wise Comparison**: The function then uses `np.all` to perform an element-wise comparison of the two arrays. The `==` operator is used to compare the elements, and `np.all` checks if all elements are `True` (i.e., equal).\n\n3. **Keyword Arguments**: The function accepts additional keyword arguments (`**kwargs`) that are passed directly to `np.all`. This allows for flexibility in specifying options like `axis`, `out`, and `keepdims`.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the function can handle inputs of different types and perform the necessary comparisons efficiently.",
