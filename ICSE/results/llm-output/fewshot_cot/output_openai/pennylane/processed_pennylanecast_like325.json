    "result": "To create a function `cast_like` that casts `tensor1` to the same data type as `tensor2`, while also handling cases where the inputs might be lists or tuples, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check the type of inputs**: Determine if the inputs are lists, tuples, or tensors.\n2. **Convert lists or tuples to tensors**: If the inputs are lists or tuples, convert them to tensors.\n3. **Cast `tensor1` to the data type of `tensor2`**: Use the appropriate method to cast `tensor1` to the data type of `tensor2`.\n4. **Return the casted tensor**: Ensure the output is in the same format as the input (list, tuple, or tensor).\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef cast_like(tensor1, tensor2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Cast tensor1 to the same data type as tensor2.\n\n    Args:\n        tensor1: A tensor, list, or tuple to be casted.\n        tensor2: A tensor, list, or tuple whose data type will be used for casting.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tensor with the same data type as tensor2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Convert inputs to tensors if they are lists or tuples\n    if isinstance(tensor1, (list, tuple)):\n        tensor1 = torch.tensor(tensor1)\n    if isinstance(tensor2, (list, tuple)):\n        tensor2 = torch.tensor(tensor2)\n\n    # 2. Cast tensor1 to the data type of tensor2\n    tensor1_casted = tensor1.to(tensor2.dtype)\n\n    # 3. Return the casted tensor\n    return tensor1_casted\n\n# Example usage:\n# tensor1 = [1, 2, 3]\n# tensor2 = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\n# result = cast_like(tensor1, tensor2)\n# print(result)  # Output: tensor([1., 2., 3.], dtype=torch.float32)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Type Checking and Conversion**: The function first checks if `tensor1` and `tensor2` are lists or tuples. If they are, it converts them to PyTorch tensors using `torch.tensor()`.\n- **Casting**: The function then casts `tensor1` to the data type of `tensor2` using the `.to()` method.\n- **Return**: Finally, it returns the casted tensor.\n\nThis function assumes that the inputs are compatible for conversion to tensors and that `tensor2` has a valid data type for casting.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called cast_like that takes in two parameters, tensor1 and tensor2. The function casts tensor1 to the same data type as tensor2.\n\nYou should be aware that input can be list or tuple aswell.",
