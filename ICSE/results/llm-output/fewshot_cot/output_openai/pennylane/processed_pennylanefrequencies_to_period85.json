    "result": "To create the `frequencies_to_period` function as described, we can follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples you provided. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef frequencies_to_period(frequencies, decimals=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the period of a Fourier series based on a set of frequencies.\n\n    The period is calculated as 2\u03c0 / gcd(frequencies), where gcd is the greatest\n    common divisor of the frequencies. If the frequencies are not integers, they\n    are rounded to the specified number of decimal places before calculating the period.\n\n    Args:\n        frequencies (tuple): A tuple of frequencies.\n        decimals (int, optional): Number of decimal places to round to. Defaults to 5.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated period.\n\n    Example:\n        frequencies = (0.5, 1.0)\n        frequencies_to_period(frequencies)\n        # Expected output: 12.566370614359172\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Try to directly compute gcd for the frequencies (works if they're integers).\n    try:\n        gcd = np.gcd.reduce(frequencies)\n    except TypeError:\n        # 2. If we have non-integer frequencies, we:\n        #    - Round them to `decimals` places\n        #    - Scale them by 10^decimals to make them integers\n        exponent = 10 ** decimals\n        rounded = np.round(frequencies, decimals) * exponent\n        \n        # 3. Convert to int and compute gcd, then scale gcd back down\n        gcd = np.gcd.reduce(np.int64(rounded)) / exponent\n\n    # 4. Return 2\u03c0 divided by the gcd for the final period\n    return 2 * np.pi / gcd\n\n# Example usage\nfrequencies = (0.5, 1.0)\nprint(frequencies_to_period(frequencies))  # Expected output: 12.566370614359172\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Importing Libraries**: We import `numpy` as it provides the `gcd` function and other utilities for numerical operations.\n\n2. **Function Definition**: The function `frequencies_to_period` takes a tuple of frequencies and an optional `decimals` parameter.\n\n3. **GCD Calculation**:\n   - We first attempt to calculate the GCD directly, assuming the frequencies are integers.\n   - If a `TypeError` occurs (indicating non-integer frequencies), we round the frequencies to the specified number of decimal places, scale them to integers, and then compute the GCD.\n\n4. **Period Calculation**: The period is calculated as \\(2\\pi/\\text{gcd}\\).\n\n5. **Return Value**: The function returns the calculated period.\n\n6. **Example Usage**: An example usage is provided in the docstring and demonstrated at the end of the code.",
