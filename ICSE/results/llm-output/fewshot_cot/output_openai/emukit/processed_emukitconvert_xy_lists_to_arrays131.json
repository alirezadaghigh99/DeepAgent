    "result": "To create the `convert_xy_lists_to_arrays` function as described, we can follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples provided. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef convert_xy_lists_to_arrays(x_list: List[np.ndarray], y_list: List[np.ndarray]) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert lists of numpy arrays representing inputs and outputs into single numpy arrays.\n    \n    Args:\n        x_list (List[np.ndarray]): List of numpy arrays for inputs, ordered by fidelity.\n        y_list (List[np.ndarray]): List of numpy arrays for outputs, ordered by fidelity.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]: Tuple containing two numpy arrays:\n            - x_array: All inputs with fidelity index as the last column.\n            - y_array: All outputs.\n    \n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the lengths of x_list and y_list are not equal.\n        ValueError: If the number of points in each fidelity level is not the same for x_list and y_list.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1. Check if the lengths of x_list and y_list are equal\n    if len(x_list) != len(y_list):\n        raise ValueError(\"x_list and y_list must have the same number of fidelity levels.\")\n    \n    # 2. Initialize lists to collect all inputs and outputs\n    all_x = []\n    all_y = []\n    \n    # 3. Iterate over each fidelity level\n    for fidelity_index, (x, y) in enumerate(zip(x_list, y_list)):\n        # 4. Check if the number of points in x and y are the same\n        if x.shape[0] != y.shape[0]:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Number of points in x_list[{fidelity_index}] and y_list[{fidelity_index}] must be the same.\")\n        \n        # 5. Append the fidelity index as the last column to x\n        fidelity_column = np.full((x.shape[0], 1), fidelity_index)\n        x_with_fidelity = np.hstack((x, fidelity_column))\n        \n        # 6. Collect the processed inputs and outputs\n        all_x.append(x_with_fidelity)\n        all_y.append(y)\n    \n    # 7. Concatenate all inputs and outputs across all fidelities\n    x_array = np.vstack(all_x)\n    y_array = np.vstack(all_y)\n    \n    # 8. Return the resulting arrays\n    return x_array, y_array\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if `x_list` and `y_list` have the same length. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Fidelity Levels**: For each pair of input and output arrays in `x_list` and `y_list`, it checks if they have the same number of points. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n3. **Append Fidelity Index**: For each input array, it appends a column containing the fidelity index. This is done using `np.hstack` to add the fidelity index as the last column.\n\n4. **Collect and Concatenate**: It collects all processed input and output arrays and concatenates them using `np.vstack` to form the final `x_array` and `y_array`.\n\n5. **Return**: Finally, it returns the concatenated arrays as a tuple.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called convert_xy_lists_to_arrays that takes in two input parameters: x_list and y_list, both of type List. The function returns a Tuple containing two numpy arrays: x_array and y_array. \n\nThe x_list parameter is a list of numpy arrays representing inputs, ordered from lowest to highest fidelity. The y_list parameter is a list of numpy arrays representing outputs, also ordered from lowest to highest fidelity. \n\nThe function first checks if the lengths of x_list and y_list are equal, raising a ValueError if they are not. It then checks if the number of points in each fidelity level is the same for both x_list and y_list, raising a ValueError if they are not. \n\nThe x_array returned contains all inputs across all fidelities with the fidelity index appended as the last column. The y_array returned contains all outputs across all fidelities. \n\nIf the function encounters any errors during the conversion process, it will raise appropriate ValueErrors.",
