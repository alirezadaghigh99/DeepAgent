    "result": "To create the `convert_x_list_to_array` function, we can follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples provided. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef convert_x_list_to_array(x_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert a list of numpy arrays into a single numpy array with an appended fidelity index.\n\n    Args:\n        x_list (list of np.ndarray): List of numpy arrays with dimensions (n_points x n_dims),\n                                     ordered from lowest to highest fidelity.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: A numpy array with features and the zero-based fidelity index as the last column.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If any of the arrays in x_list do not have 2 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Initialize an empty list to store arrays with appended fidelity index\n    arrays_with_fidelity = []\n\n    # 2. Iterate over the list of arrays with their index (fidelity level)\n    for fidelity_index, x in enumerate(x_list):\n        # 3. Check if the current array has 2 dimensions\n        if x.ndim != 2:\n            raise ValueError(\"All x arrays must have 2 dimensions\")\n\n        # 4. Create an array of the same length as x with the fidelity index\n        fidelity_column = np.full((x.shape[0], 1), fidelity_index)\n\n        # 5. Concatenate the fidelity index as the last column of the current array\n        x_with_fidelity = np.hstack((x, fidelity_column))\n\n        # 6. Append the modified array to the list\n        arrays_with_fidelity.append(x_with_fidelity)\n\n    # 7. Concatenate all arrays in the list along the first axis to form the final output\n    result_array = np.vstack(arrays_with_fidelity)\n\n    # 8. Return the resulting numpy array\n    return result_array\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialize a List**: We start by initializing an empty list `arrays_with_fidelity` to store the modified arrays.\n\n2. **Iterate with Index**: We iterate over `x_list` using `enumerate` to get both the array and its index, which represents the fidelity level.\n\n3. **Dimension Check**: For each array, we check if it has exactly 2 dimensions using `x.ndim`. If not, we raise a `ValueError`.\n\n4. **Create Fidelity Column**: We create a column of the same length as the number of points in the array, filled with the current fidelity index.\n\n5. **Concatenate**: We concatenate this fidelity column to the current array using `np.hstack`.\n\n6. **Append to List**: We append the modified array to `arrays_with_fidelity`.\n\n7. **Final Concatenation**: After processing all arrays, we concatenate them along the first axis using `np.vstack` to form the final output array.\n\n8. **Return**: Finally, we return the resulting numpy array.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called convert_x_list_to_array that takes in a list of numpy arrays called x_list and returns a numpy array with all features and the zero-based fidelity index appended as the last column. The input should be a list of numpy arrays with dimensions (n_points x n_dims) ordered from lowest to highest fidelity. The output should be a numpy array with the features and fidelity index concatenated. If any of the arrays in x_list do not have 2 dimensions, a ValueError should be raised. raise value error of All x arrays must have 2 dimensions",
