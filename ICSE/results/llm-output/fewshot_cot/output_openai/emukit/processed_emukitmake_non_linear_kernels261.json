    "result": "To create the `make_non_linear_kernels` function, we need to construct a list of structured multi-fidelity kernels using a specified base kernel class from GPy. The function will generate kernels for multiple fidelity levels, where each kernel is constructed based on the previous fidelity's kernel. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport GPy\n\ndef make_non_linear_kernels(base_kernel_class, n_fidelities, n_input_dims, ARD=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs a list of structured multi-fidelity kernels using a specified base kernel class from GPy.\n\n    Args:\n        base_kernel_class: The GPy kernel class to use.\n        n_fidelities: Number of fidelity levels.\n        n_input_dims: Number of input dimensions.\n        ARD: Boolean indicating whether to use Automatic Relevance Determination.\n\n    Returns:\n        List of kernels, one per fidelity level, from lowest to highest fidelity.\n    \"\"\"\n    kernels = []\n\n    # Create the kernel for the first fidelity level\n    first_fidelity_kernel = base_kernel_class(input_dim=n_input_dims, ARD=ARD)\n    kernels.append(first_fidelity_kernel)\n\n    # Construct kernels for subsequent fidelity levels\n    for i in range(1, n_fidelities):\n        # Kernel for the current fidelity level\n        current_fidelity_kernel = base_kernel_class(input_dim=n_input_dims, ARD=ARD)\n        \n        # Kernel for the previous fidelity level\n        previous_fidelity_kernel = kernels[i - 1]\n        \n        # Construct the kernel for the current fidelity level\n        # by multiplying the current and previous fidelity kernels and adding a bias kernel\n        combined_kernel = (current_fidelity_kernel * previous_fidelity_kernel) + base_kernel_class(input_dim=n_input_dims, ARD=ARD)\n        \n        # Append the constructed kernel to the list\n        kernels.append(combined_kernel)\n\n    return kernels\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by creating an empty list `kernels` to store the kernels for each fidelity level.\n\n2. **First Fidelity Level**: The kernel for the first fidelity level is simply the base kernel applied to the input dimensions. We create this kernel and append it to the `kernels` list.\n\n3. **Subsequent Fidelity Levels**: For each subsequent fidelity level, we:\n   - Create a new kernel for the current fidelity level using the base kernel class.\n   - Retrieve the kernel from the previous fidelity level.\n   - Construct the current fidelity's kernel by multiplying the current and previous fidelity kernels and adding another base kernel for bias.\n   - Append the constructed kernel to the `kernels` list.\n\n4. **Return**: Finally, we return the list of kernels, which contains one kernel per fidelity level, from the lowest to the highest fidelity.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function `make_non_linear_kernels` that constructs a list of structured multi-fidelity kernels using a specified base kernel class from GPy. The function should accept the following parameters: `base_kernel_class` (the GPy kernel class to use), `n_fidelities` (number of fidelity levels), `n_input_dims` (number of input dimensions), and `ARD` (a boolean indicating whether to use Automatic Relevance Determination, i.e., different lengthscales for different dimensions). The function should return a list of kernels, with one kernel per fidelity level, starting from the lowest to the highest fidelity. For the first fidelity, the kernel is simply the base kernel applied to the input dimensions. For subsequent fidelities, the kernel is constructed by multiplying the base kernel applied to the current fidelity with the base kernel applied to the previous fidelity, and adding another base kernel for bias. Default value of ARD is False",
