    "result": "To complete the `triangular_kernel1d` function, we need to generate a 1D triangular kernel of a specified size. The kernel should have a peak in the center and taper off symmetrically towards the edges. Given that the kernel size is odd, the center of the kernel will be at the middle index. Here's how you can implement this function using TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ndef triangular_kernel1d(kernel_size: int) -> tf.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a 1D triangular kernel for LocalNormalizedCrossCorrelation.\n\n    Assume kernel_size is odd, it will be a smoothed from\n    a kernel which center part is zero.\n    Then length of the ones will be around half kernel_size.\n    The weight scale of the kernel does not matter as LNCC will normalize it.\n\n    :param kernel_size: scalar, size of the 1-D kernel\n    :return: kernel_weights, of shape (kernel_size, )\n    \"\"\"\n    assert kernel_size >= 3\n    assert kernel_size % 2 != 0\n\n    # 1. Calculate the center index of the kernel\n    center = kernel_size // 2\n\n    # 2. Create a range from 0 to kernel_size - 1\n    indices = tf.range(kernel_size, dtype=tf.float32)\n\n    # 3. Calculate the triangular values\n    #    The value at each index is determined by its distance from the center\n    kernel_weights = 1.0 - tf.abs(indices - center) / center\n\n    # 4. Return the kernel weights as a TensorFlow tensor\n    return kernel_weights\n\n# Example usage:\n# kernel = triangular_kernel1d(5)\n# print(kernel.numpy())  # Output: [0.  0.5 1.  0.5 0. ]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Center Calculation**: The center of the kernel is calculated as `kernel_size // 2`, which gives the middle index for an odd-sized kernel.\n2. **Index Range**: We create a range of indices from `0` to `kernel_size - 1`.\n3. **Triangular Values**: The value at each index is calculated based on its distance from the center. The formula `1.0 - tf.abs(indices - center) / center` creates a triangular shape, with the peak at the center and tapering off symmetrically.\n4. **Return Tensor**: The resulting kernel weights are returned as a TensorFlow tensor.\n\nThis function will generate a 1D triangular kernel that can be used for operations like Local Normalized Cross-Correlation (LNCC).",
