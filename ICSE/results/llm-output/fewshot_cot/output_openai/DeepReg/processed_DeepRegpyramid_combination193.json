    "result": "To create the `pyramid_combination` function, we need to perform linear interpolation based on the values at the corners of a hypercube in an n-dimensional space. The function will use the provided `values`, `weight_floor`, and `weight_ceil` to compute the interpolated result. Here's a step-by-step implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef pyramid_combination(values: List[torch.Tensor], weight_floor: List[torch.Tensor], weight_ceil: List[torch.Tensor]) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform linear interpolation based on values at the corners of a hypercube in an n-dimensional space.\n\n    Args:\n        values (List[torch.Tensor]): List of tensors representing values at the corners of the hypercube.\n        weight_floor (List[torch.Tensor]): List of tensors representing the floor interpolation weights.\n        weight_ceil (List[torch.Tensor]): List of tensors representing the ceil interpolation weights.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: Interpolated tensor with the same shape as the elements in `values`.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the dimensions of the inputs are mismatched or if the length of `values` is not `2^n`.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Determine the dimensionality of the hypercube\n    n = len(weight_floor)\n    \n    # 2. Validate that the length of `values` is `2^n`\n    if len(values) != 2 ** n:\n        raise ValueError(f\"The length of `values` must be 2^{n}, but got {len(values)}.\")\n\n    # 3. Validate that `weight_floor` and `weight_ceil` have the same length\n    if len(weight_floor) != len(weight_ceil):\n        raise ValueError(\"`weight_floor` and `weight_ceil` must have the same length.\")\n\n    # 4. Initialize the result tensor with zeros, having the same shape as the elements in `values`\n    result = torch.zeros_like(values[0])\n\n    # 5. Iterate over each corner of the hypercube\n    for i in range(2 ** n):\n        # 6. Calculate the weight for the current corner\n        corner_weight = torch.ones_like(result)\n        for j in range(n):\n            if (i >> j) & 1:\n                corner_weight *= weight_ceil[j]\n            else:\n                corner_weight *= weight_floor[j]\n\n        # 7. Accumulate the weighted value for the current corner\n        result += corner_weight * values[i]\n\n    # 8. Return the interpolated result\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Determine Dimensionality**: The dimensionality `n` is determined by the length of `weight_floor` (or `weight_ceil` since they must be the same length).\n\n2. **Validation**: The function checks if the length of `values` is `2^n`, ensuring it matches the number of corners in an n-dimensional hypercube. It also checks that `weight_floor` and `weight_ceil` have the same length.\n\n3. **Initialize Result**: A result tensor is initialized with zeros, having the same shape as the elements in `values`.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Corners**: The function iterates over each corner of the hypercube. For each corner, it calculates a weight based on the binary representation of the corner index `i`. If the j-th bit of `i` is set, it uses `weight_ceil[j]`; otherwise, it uses `weight_floor[j]`.\n\n5. **Accumulate Weighted Values**: The weighted value for each corner is accumulated into the result tensor.\n\n6. **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns the interpolated result tensor.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `pyramid_combination` that performs linear interpolation based on values at the corners of a hypercube in an n-dimensional space. The function accepts three main inputs: `values` (a list of tensors representing values at the corners), `weight_floor`, and `weight_ceil` (lists of tensors representing the interpolation weights). The function ensures that the shapes of the inputs are compatible, with `values` needing to have a length of `2^n` where `n` is the length of `weight_floor` and `weight_ceil`. It returns a tensor with the same shape as the elements in `values`.\n\nThe function includes error handling to check for mismatched dimensions between `values`, `weight_floor`, and `weight_ceil`, and also validates that the length of `values` matches the expected `2^n` based on the dimension of the weights. If these conditions are not met, the function raises a `ValueError`.",
