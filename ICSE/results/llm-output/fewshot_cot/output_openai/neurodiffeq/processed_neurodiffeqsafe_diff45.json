    "result": "To create the `safe_diff` function that computes the derivative of a variable `u` with respect to another variable `t` using PyTorch tensors, we can follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples provided.

Return the computed derivative\n    return derivative\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Shape Validation**: The function first checks if `u` and `t` have the correct shape `(n_samples, 1)`. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Shape Consistency**: It ensures that `u` and `t` have the same shape, raising a `ValueError` if they do not.\n\n3. **Difference Calculation**: It calculates the differences between consecutive elements in `t` and `u` to approximate the derivative.\n\n4. **First Derivative**: The first derivative is computed as the ratio of differences `du/dt`.\n\n5. **Higher Order Derivatives**: If a higher order derivative is requested, the function iteratively computes the derivative of the previously computed derivative.\n\n6. **Return**: Finally, the function returns the computed derivative as a PyTorch tensor.",
