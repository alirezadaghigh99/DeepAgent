    "result": "To complete the `inverse_transform` function, we need to apply the inverse transformation to the whitened data `x`. This typically involves using a precomputed inverse transformation matrix, which is stored in `self.transform_inv`. Here's how you can complete the function:\n\n```python\ndef inverse_transform(self, x: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n    r\"\"\"Apply the inverse transform to the whitened data.\n\n    Args:\n        x: Whitened data.\n\n    Returns:\n        Original data.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not self.fitted:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Needs to be fitted first before running. Please call fit or set include_fit to True.\")\n\n    if not self.compute_inv:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Did not compute inverse ZCA. Please set compute_inv to True\")\n\n    if self.transform_inv is None:\n        raise TypeError(\"The transform inverse should be a Tensor. Gotcha None.\")\n\n    # Apply the inverse transformation\n    # Assuming x is centered, we apply the inverse transformation matrix\n    original_data = torch.matmul(x, self.transform_inv)\n\n    return original_data\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Check Preconditions**: The function first checks if the transformation has been fitted and if the inverse transformation matrix has been computed. If not, it raises appropriate errors.\n\n2. **Apply Inverse Transformation**: The core of the function is applying the inverse transformation matrix (`self.transform_inv`) to the whitened data `x`. This is done using matrix multiplication (`torch.matmul`), which effectively reverses the whitening process.\n\n3. **Return Original Data**: The result of the matrix multiplication is the original data, which is returned by the function.\n\nThis implementation assumes that `x` is already centered (i.e., mean-subtracted) if necessary, as the inverse transformation typically assumes this. If centering is part of the transformation, you might need to add or subtract a mean vector to `x` before or after applying the inverse transformation.",
