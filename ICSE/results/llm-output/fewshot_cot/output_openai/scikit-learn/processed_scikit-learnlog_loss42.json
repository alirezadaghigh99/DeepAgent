    "result": "To create a Python function called `log_loss` that calculates the log loss (also known as logistic loss or cross-entropy loss), we can follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples you provided. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef log_loss(y_true, y_pred, normalize=True, sample_weight=None, labels=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the log loss, also known as logistic loss or cross-entropy loss.\n\n    Args:\n        y_true (array-like): Ground truth labels for n_samples samples.\n        y_pred (array-like): Predicted probabilities from a classifier's predict_proba method.\n        normalize (bool): Whether to return the mean loss per sample or the sum of per-sample losses.\n        sample_weight (array-like, optional): Optional sample weights.\n        labels (array-like, optional): Optional labels for the classes.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The log loss value.\n\n    Examples:\n        >>> y_true = [0, 1, 1]\n        >>> y_pred = [0.1, 0.9, 0.8]\n        >>> log_loss(y_true, y_pred)\n        0.164252033486018\n\n    Notes:\n        - Log loss is a measure of the performance of a classification model where the prediction is a probability value between 0 and 1.\n        - It is commonly used in binary classification problems.\n\n    References:\n        - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.log_loss.html\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Convert inputs to numpy arrays for consistent handling\n    y_true = np.array(y_true)\n    y_pred = np.array(y_pred)\n\n    # 2. Handle sample weights, defaulting to equal weights if not provided\n    if sample_weight is None:\n        sample_weight = np.ones_like(y_true, dtype=float)\n    else:\n        sample_weight = np.array(sample_weight)\n\n    # 3. Ensure y_pred is clipped to avoid log(0) errors\n    eps = np.finfo(float).eps\n    y_pred = np.clip(y_pred, eps, 1 - eps)\n\n    # 4. Calculate the log loss for each sample\n    loss = - (y_true * np.log(y_pred) + (1 - y_true) * np.log(1 - y_pred))\n\n    # 5. Apply sample weights to the loss\n    weighted_loss = sample_weight * loss\n\n    # 6. Return the mean or sum of the weighted loss based on the normalize parameter\n    if normalize:\n        return np.average(weighted_loss)\n    else:\n        return np.sum(weighted_loss)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    y_true = [0, 1, 1]\n    y_pred = [0.1, 0.9, 0.8]\n    print(log_loss(y_true, y_pred))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Conversion**: Convert `y_true` and `y_pred` to numpy arrays for consistent handling.\n2. **Sample Weights**: If `sample_weight` is not provided, default to equal weights.\n3. **Clipping**: Clip `y_pred` to avoid log(0) errors, which can occur if probabilities are exactly 0 or 1.\n4. **Log Loss Calculation**: Compute the log loss for each sample using the formula for binary cross-entropy.\n5. **Weight Application**: Apply sample weights to the calculated loss.\n6. **Normalization**: Return either the mean or sum of the weighted loss based on the `normalize` parameter.\n\nThis function provides a basic implementation of log loss calculation, suitable for binary classification problems. For multi-class problems, additional handling of class labels and probabilities would be necessary.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called log_loss that calculates the log loss, also known as logistic loss or cross-entropy loss. The function takes in the following parameters:\n\n- y_true: Ground truth labels for n_samples samples.\n- y_pred: Predicted probabilities from a classifier's predict_proba method.\n- normalize: A boolean indicating whether to return the mean loss per sample or the sum of per-sample losses.\n- sample_weight: Optional sample weights.\n- labels: Optional labels for the classes.\n\nThe function calculates the log loss based on the predicted probabilities and true labels.
