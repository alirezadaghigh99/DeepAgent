    "result": "To create the `d2_log_loss_score` function, we need to calculate the D\u00b2 score, which measures the fraction of log loss explained by a model. This involves computing the log loss for the predicted probabilities and comparing it to a baseline log loss.

Ensure y_true and y_pred have consistent lengths\n    check_consistent_length(y_true, y_pred, sample_weight)\n\n    # 3. Infer labels if not provided\n    if labels is None:\n        labels = unique_labels(y_true)\n\n    # 4. Convert y_true to a binary indicator matrix if necessary\n    y_true = check_array(y_true, ensure_2d=False)\n    if y_true.ndim == 1:\n        y_true = np.eye(len(labels))[y_true]\n\n    # 5.

Calculate the baseline log loss using the class proportions\n    class_counts = np.bincount(y_true.argmax(axis=1), weights=sample_weight)\n    class_probs = class_counts / class_counts.sum()\n    y_pred_baseline = np.tile(class_probs, (y_true.shape[0], 1))\n    ll_baseline = log_loss(y_true, y_pred_baseline, sample_weight=sample_weight, labels=labels)\n\n    # 7.

    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called d2_log_loss_score that calculates the D^2 score, which is the fraction of log loss explained. The function takes in the following parameters:\n\n- y_true: array-like or label indicator matrix, representing the actual labels for the samples.\n- y_pred: array-like of shape (n_samples, n_classes) or (n_samples,), representing the predicted probabilities from a classifier.\n- sample_weight: array-like of shape (n_samples,), representing sample weights.\n- labels: array-like, representing the labels. If not provided, they will be inferred from y_true.\n\nThe function returns the D^2 score as a float or ndarray of floats. It may be negative and is not well-defined for a single sample. The best possible score is 1.0, and a model that always predicts the per-class proportions of y_true gets a score of 0.0. The function also handles cases where the number of samples is less than two, returning a NaN value in such cases.if _num_samples(y_pred) < 2:\n        msg = \"D^2 score is not well-defined with less than two samples.\"\n        warnings.warn(msg, UndefinedMetricWarning)\n        return float(\"nan\")",
