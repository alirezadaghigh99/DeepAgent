Convert col_data to a NumPy array and remove missing values (NaN)\n    col_data = np.asarray(col_data)\n    col_data = col_data[~np.isnan(col_data)]\n\n    # 2.

    "prompt": "Create a Python function called _find_binning_thresholds that extracts quantiles from a continuous feature. The function takes two parameters: col_data, an array-like object representing the continuous feature to bin, and max_bins, an integer indicating the maximum number of bins to use for non-missing values. \n\nThe function ignores missing values when finding the thresholds and returns an ndarray of shape (min(max_bins, n_unique_values) - 1) containing increasing numeric values that can be used to separate the bins. A value x will be mapped into bin value i if binning_thresholds[i - 1] < x <= binning_thresholds[i].\n\nThe function first removes missing values from col_data, sorts the data, and identifies distinct values. If the number of distinct values is less than or equal to max_bins, it calculates midpoints between consecutive distinct values. Otherwise, it computes approximate midpoint percentiles using the percentile function.\n\nThe function ensures that there are no +inf thresholds and returns the calculated midpoints as the output.",
