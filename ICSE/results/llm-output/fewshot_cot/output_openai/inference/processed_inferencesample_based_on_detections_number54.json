If either condition is true, it returns `False`.\n\n3. **Counting Detections**: The function uses a helper function `count_detections_close_to_threshold` to count the number of detections that are close to a specified threshold. This function should be implemented based on the structure of the prediction object.\n\n4. **Range Check**: The function checks if the number of detections falls within the specified range defined by `more_than` and `less_than`. If the number of detections does not meet these criteria, it returns `False`.\n\n5. **Probability Check**: If the number of detections is within the specified range, the function returns `True` with a probability defined by the `probability` parameter. This is done using a random number generator.\n\nThis implementation provides a flexible way to decide whether to sample an image based on detection results, with customizable conditions and randomness.",
    "prompt": "Define a Python function called sample_based_on_detections_number that takes in parameters including an image as a NumPy array, a prediction object, a prediction type, optional integer values for more_than and less_than, a set of selected class names, and a probability value. The function returns a boolean value.\n\nWithin the function, it first checks if the prediction is a stub or if the prediction type is not in a predefined list of eligible types, in which case it returns False. It then calculates the number of detections close to a threshold using the count_detections_close_to_threshold function with specific parameters. \n\nAfterwards, it checks if the calculated value falls within a specified range based on the more_than and less_than parameters. If it does, the function returns True with a probability determined by a random number generator. Otherwise, it returns False.",
