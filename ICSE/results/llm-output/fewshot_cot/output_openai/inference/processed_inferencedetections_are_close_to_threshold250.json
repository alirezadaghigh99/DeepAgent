If the difference is within the epsilon, it increments the counter.\n\n4. **Comparison**: The main function compares the count of close detections with the minimum number of objects required and returns a boolean result.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the `Prediction` object has a `detections` attribute, which is iterable and contains objects with `class_name` and `score` attributes. Adjust the implementation as needed based on the actual structure of your `Prediction` object.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called detections_are_close_to_threshold that takes in a Prediction object, a set of selected class names, a threshold value, an epsilon value, and a minimum number of objects close to the threshold. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the number of detections close to the threshold is greater than or equal to the minimum number specified. The function calls another function called count_detections_close_to_threshold to calculate the number of detections close to the threshold.",
