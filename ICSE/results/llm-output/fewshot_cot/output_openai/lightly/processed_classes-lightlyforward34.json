    "result": "To implement the `forward` function for the `SwaVLoss` class, we need to compute the SwaV loss using the high-resolution and low-resolution outputs. The function should also handle optional queue outputs and calculate the final loss by averaging sublosses across different views. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass SwaVLoss(nn.Module):\n    def subloss(self, z: torch.Tensor, q: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        # This method should compute the cross-entropy loss between predictions z and codes q.\n        # Assuming q is a one-hot encoded tensor, we can use torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy.\n        return nn.functional.cross_entropy(z, q.argmax(dim=1))\n\n    def forward(\n        self,\n        high_resolution_outputs: List[torch.Tensor],\n        low_resolution_outputs: List[torch.Tensor],\n        queue_outputs: List[torch.Tensor] = None\n    ) -> torch.Tensor:\n        \"\"\"\n        Compute the SwaV loss using high-resolution and low-resolution outputs.\n\n        Args:\n            high_resolution_outputs (List[torch.Tensor]): List of high-resolution output tensors.\n            low_resolution_outputs (List[torch.Tensor]): List of low-resolution output tensors.\n            queue_outputs (List[torch.Tensor], optional): List of queue output tensors. Defaults to None.\n\n        Returns:\n            torch.Tensor: The computed SwaV loss.\n        \"\"\"\n        # 1. Initialize a list to store sublosses\n        sublosses = []\n\n        # 2. Compute sublosses for high-resolution outputs\n        for i, z in enumerate(high_resolution_outputs):\n            # Use the subloss method to compute the loss between z and its corresponding q\n            q = low_resolution_outputs[i]\n            subloss = self.subloss(z, q)\n            sublosses.append(subloss)\n\n        # 3. If queue outputs are provided, compute sublosses for them as well\n        if queue_outputs is not None:\n            for i, z in enumerate(queue_outputs):\n                # Use the subloss method to compute the loss between z and its corresponding q\n                q = low_resolution_outputs[i]\n                subloss = self.subloss(z, q)\n                sublosses.append(subloss)\n\n        # 4. Calculate the final loss by averaging all sublosses\n        final_loss = torch.mean(torch.stack(sublosses))\n\n        # 5. Return the final SwaV loss\n        return final_loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Subloss Calculation**: The `subloss` method computes the cross-entropy loss between predictions `z` and codes `q`. It assumes `q` is one-hot encoded, so it uses `q.argmax(dim=1)` to get the class indices.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Outputs**: The `forward` method iterates over the high-resolution outputs and computes the subloss for each pair of high-resolution and low-resolution outputs.\n\n3. **Queue Outputs**: If `queue_outputs` are provided, it computes additional sublosses for these outputs against the low-resolution outputs.\n\n4. **Average Sublosses**: The final loss is computed by averaging all the sublosses using `torch.mean`.\n\n5. **Return Loss**: The function returns the computed SwaV loss as a `torch.Tensor`.",
