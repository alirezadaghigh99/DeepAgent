    "result": "To create a function that calculates the average endpoint error (AEPE) between two flow maps, we can follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples provided. Here's how you can implement this function in Python using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef aepe(input: torch.Tensor, target: torch.Tensor, reduction: str = 'mean') -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Average Endpoint Error (AEPE) between two flow maps.\n\n    AEPE is the endpoint error between two 2D vectors (e.g., optical flow).\n    Given a h x w x 2 optical flow map, the AEPE is:\n\n    .. math::\n\n        \\text{AEPE}=\\frac{1}{hw}\\sum_{i=1, j=1}^{h, w}\\sqrt{(I_{i,j,1}-T_{i,j,1})^{2}+(I_{i,j,2}-T_{i,j,2})^{2}}\n\n    Args:\n        input (Tensor): The input flow map with shape :math:`(*, 2)`.\n        target (Tensor): The target flow map with shape :math:`(*, 2)`.\n        reduction (str): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output: \n                         ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. \n                         ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,\n                         ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of elements\n                         in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor: The computed AEPE as a scalar or tensor depending on the reduction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

Sum the squared differences along the last dimension (2D vector components)\n    sum_squared_diff = squared_diff.sum(dim=-1)\n\n    # 4.

If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Squared Differences**: It calculates the squared differences between the corresponding elements of the input and target flow maps.\n\n3. **Sum of Squared Differences**: It sums these squared differences along the last dimension, which represents the 2D vector components.\n\n4. **Endpoint Error**: It computes the square root of the summed squared differences to obtain the endpoint error for each pixel.\n\n5. **Reduction**: Depending on the `reduction` argument, it either returns the raw endpoint errors, their mean, or their sum.\n\nThis function is flexible and can handle different reduction methods, making it suitable for various use cases.",
