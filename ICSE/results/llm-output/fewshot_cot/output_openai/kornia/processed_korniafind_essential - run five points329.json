    "result": "Creating a function to compute the essential matrix using Nister's 5-point algorithm involves several steps. Below is a step-by-step guide to implementing the `run_5point` function.

This involves creating a matrix `A` where each row corresponds to a point pair and is constructed using the epipolar constraint.\n\n3. **Applying Weights**: If weights are provided, they are applied to the matrix `A` to weight the contribution of each point pair.\n\n4. **Solving for the Essential Matrix**: The essential matrix is computed using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the matrix `A`. The solution is the right singular vector corresponding to the smallest singular value, reshaped into a 3x3 matrix.\n\n5. **Returning the Result**: The function returns a tensor containing the essential matrix for each batch.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input points are already calibrated (i.e., they are in normalized camera coordinates). The function uses PyTorch for tensor operations, which allows for efficient computation on GPUs if needed.",
