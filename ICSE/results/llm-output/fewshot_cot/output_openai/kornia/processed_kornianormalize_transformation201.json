    "result": "To create the `normalize_transformation` function as described, we can follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples provided. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef normalize_transformation(M: torch.Tensor, eps: float = 1e-8) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Normalize a transformation matrix so that the value in the last row and column is set to one.\n\n    Args:\n        M (torch.Tensor): A tensor representing a transformation matrix with at least 2x2 dimensions.\n        eps (float): A small float value to avoid numerical instabilities during backpropagation.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: The normalized transformation matrix with the same shape as the input.\n\n    Raises:\n        AssertionError: If the input matrix M has fewer than 2 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Assert that the input matrix M has at least 2 dimensions\n    assert M.ndim >= 2, \"Input matrix M must have at least 2 dimensions.\"\n\n    # 2. Extract the shape of the input matrix\n    shape = M.shape\n\n    # 3. Identify the indices of the last row and last column\n    last_row_idx = shape[-2] - 1\n    last_col_idx = shape[-1] - 1\n\n    # 4. Extract the value at the last row and column to use for normalization\n    normalization_value = M[..., last_row_idx, last_col_idx]\n\n    # 5. Avoid division by zero by adding a small epsilon value\n    normalization_value = normalization_value + eps\n\n    # 6. Normalize the entire matrix by dividing by the normalization value\n    M_normalized = M / normalization_value[..., None, None]\n\n    # 7. Set the value at the last row and column to exactly one\n    M_normalized[..., last_row_idx, last_col_idx] = 1.0\n\n    # 8. Return the normalized transformation matrix\n    return M_normalized\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Assertion**: We start by asserting that the input matrix `M` has at least 2 dimensions. This ensures that the matrix is valid for transformation operations.\n\n2. **Shape Extraction**: We extract the shape of the matrix to determine the indices of the last row and column.\n\n3. **Normalization Value**: We extract the value at the last row and column, which will be used to normalize the matrix.\n\n4. **Avoid Division by Zero**: We add a small epsilon value to the normalization value to prevent division by zero, which can cause numerical instability.\n\n5. **Normalization**: We divide the entire matrix by the normalization value to scale it appropriately.\n\n6. **Set Last Element**: We explicitly set the value at the last row and column to 1.0 to ensure the matrix is properly normalized.\n\n7. **Return**: Finally, we return the normalized transformation matrix.",
    "prompt": "---\n\nCreate a Python function `normalize_transformation` that:\n\n- Accepts two parameters:\n  - `M`: A tensor representing a transformation matrix of any shape with at least 2x2 dimensions.\n  - `eps`: A small float value (default is `1e-8`) used to avoid numerical instabilities during backpropagation.\n- The function normalizes the input transformation matrix `M` so that the value in the last row and column is set to one.\n- Returns the normalized transformation matrix with the same shape as the input.\n\nErrors:\n- Raises an `AssertionError` if the input matrix `M` has fewer than 2 dimensions.",
