If scale_factor is a tensor, ensure it is broadcastable to the shape (B, 1, 1)\n    if isinstance(scale_factor, torch.Tensor) and scale_factor.shape not in [(1,), (camera_matrix.shape[0], 1, 1)]:\n        raise ValueError(\"scale_factor tensor must be broadcastable to shape (B, 1, 1)\")\n\n    # 4. Scale the focal length and center of projection\n    #    - Focal lengths are at positions (0, 0) and (1, 1)\n    #    - Center of projection is at positions (0, 2) and (1, 2)\n    scaled_camera_matrix = camera_matrix.clone()\n    scaled_camera_matrix[:, 0, 0] *= scale_factor  # Scale fx\n    scaled_camera_matrix[:, 1, 1] *= scale_factor  # Scale fy\n    scaled_camera_matrix[:, 0, 2] *= scale_factor  # Scale cx\n    scaled_camera_matrix[:, 1, 2] *= scale_factor  # Scale cy\n\n    # 5. Return the scaled camera matrix\n    return scaled_camera_matrix\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: We first check if the `camera_matrix` has the correct shape `(B, 3, 3)`. We also ensure that `scale_factor` is either a float or a tensor.\n\n2. **Broadcasting Check**: If `scale_factor` is a tensor, we ensure it can be broadcasted to the shape `(B, 1, 1)` to allow element-wise multiplication with the camera matrix.\n\n3. **Scaling**: We scale the focal lengths (`fx` and `fy`) and the center of projection (`cx` and `cy`) by the `scale_factor`. These are located at specific positions in the camera matrix.\n\n4. **Return**: Finally, we return the scaled camera matrix, maintaining the original shape `(B, 3, 3)`.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called scale_intrinsics that takes in a camera matrix (with shape (B, 3, 3)) containing intrinsic parameters and a scale factor (either a float or a tensor) as input. The function scales the focal length and center of projection in the camera matrix by the given scale factor. \n\nThe function then returns the scaled camera matrix with the same shape as the input (B, 3, 3).",
