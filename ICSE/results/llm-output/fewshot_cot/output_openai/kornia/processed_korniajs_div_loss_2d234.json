    "result": "To create a function `js_div_loss_2d` that calculates the Jensen-Shannon divergence loss between two heatmaps, we can follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples you provided. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef js_div_loss_2d(pred: torch.Tensor, target: torch.Tensor, reduction: str = 'mean') -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Jensen-Shannon divergence loss between two heatmaps.\n\n    Args:\n        pred (Tensor): Predicted tensor of shape (B, N, H, W).\n        target (Tensor): Target tensor of shape (B, N, H, W).\n        reduction (str): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output: 'none', 'mean', or 'sum'.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor: The calculated loss.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Ensure the input tensors are probability distributions by applying softmax\n    pred = F.softmax(pred, dim=-1)\n    target = F.softmax(target, dim=-1)\n\n    # 2. Calculate the pointwise mean of the two distributions\n    m = 0.5 * (pred + target)\n\n    # 3. Compute the Kullback-Leibler divergence for each distribution with respect to m\n    kl_div_pred = F.kl_div(pred.log(), m, reduction='none')\n    kl_div_target = F.kl_div(target.log(), m, reduction='none')\n\n    # 4. Calculate the Jensen-Shannon divergence\n    js_div = 0.5 * (kl_div_pred + kl_div_target)\n\n    # 5. Apply the specified reduction method\n    if reduction == 'mean':\n        return js_div.mean()\n    elif reduction == 'sum':\n        return js_div.sum()\n    elif reduction == 'none':\n        return js_div\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Invalid reduction type: {reduction}. Choose from 'none', 'mean', or 'sum'.\")\n\n# Example usage\npred = torch.full((1, 1, 2, 4), 0.125)\nloss = js_div_loss_2d(pred, pred)\nprint(loss.item())  # Should return 0.0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Softmax Normalization**: We first ensure that both `pred` and `target` are valid probability distributions by applying the softmax function along the last dimension.\n\n2. **Mean Distribution**: We compute the mean distribution `m` as the average of `pred` and `target`.\n\n3. **KL Divergence**: We calculate the Kullback-Leibler divergence of each distribution (`pred` and `target`) with respect to `m`.\n\n4. **Jensen-Shannon Divergence**: The Jensen-Shannon divergence is computed as the average of the two KL divergences.\n\n5. **Reduction**: We apply the specified reduction method to the resulting divergence tensor. The function supports 'none', 'mean', and 'sum' reductions.\n\nThis function should correctly compute the Jensen-Shannon divergence loss between two heatmaps, and the example usage demonstrates that the loss is zero when `pred` and `target` are identical.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called js_div_loss_2d that calculates the Jensen-Shannon divergence loss between two heatmaps. The function takes three arguments: pred (input tensor with shape (B, N, H, W)), target (target tensor with shape (B, N, H, W)), and reduction (specifies the reduction to apply to the output: 'none', 'mean', or 'sum'). The function returns a tensor.\n\nExample usage:\npred = torch.full((1, 1, 2, 4), 0.125)\nloss = js_div_loss_2d(pred, pred)\nloss.item() should return 0.0.",
