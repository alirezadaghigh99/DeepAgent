The solution with the most points having positive depth is selected as the best solution.\n\n6. **Return**: The function returns the best rotation matrix, translation vector, and triangulated 3D points.\n\nThis implementation assumes the presence of a helper function `triangulate_points` to perform the triangulation of 3D points from the 2D correspondences and projection matrices.",
    "prompt": "Create a function `motion_from_essential_choose_solution` that recovers the relative camera rotation and translation from an estimated essential matrix `E_mat`. The function checks corresponding points in two images using the camera matrices `K1` and `K2` and returns the best solution along with the triangulated 3D points. Input tensors include the essential matrix (`E_mat`), camera matrices (`K1`, `K2`), and point sets (`x1`, `x2`). An optional `mask` can exclude points from choosing the best solution. The function returns a tuple containing the rotation matrix, translation vector, and 3D points. Errors are raised for incorrect input shapes, and batch dimensions are handled appropriately.",
