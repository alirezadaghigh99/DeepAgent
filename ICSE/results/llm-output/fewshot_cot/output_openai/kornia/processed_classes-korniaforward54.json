    "result": "To implement the `forward` method for the `Rot180` class, you need to rotate the input tensor by 180 degrees. This can be achieved by flipping the tensor both vertically and horizontally. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom torch.nn import Module\n\nclass Rot180(Module):\n    def forward(self, input: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # Flip the tensor vertically and horizontally to achieve a 180-degree rotation\n        return torch.flip(input, dims=(-2, -1))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Shape Handling**: The input tensor can be of shape `(C, H, W)` or a batch of tensors with shape `(*, C, H, W)`. The `torch.flip` function can handle both cases.\n\n2. **Flipping Dimensions**: \n   - `dims=(-2, -1)` specifies that the last two dimensions should be flipped. \n   - For a single image tensor `(C, H, W)`, this corresponds to flipping the height (`H`) and width (`W`).\n   - For a batch of images `(*, C, H, W)`, it still correctly flips the height and width of each image in the batch.\n\n3. **Rotation by 180 Degrees**: Flipping both vertically and horizontally results in a 180-degree rotation of the image.\n\nThis implementation is efficient and leverages PyTorch's built-in operations to handle the rotation.",
