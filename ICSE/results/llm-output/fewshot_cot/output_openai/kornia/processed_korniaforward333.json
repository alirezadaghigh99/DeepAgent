    "result": "To implement the `forward` function for the `STEFunction` class, we need to understand that the forward pass of a custom autograd function in PyTorch typically involves saving any necessary context for the backward pass and returning the output tensor. In the case of the Straight-Through Estimation (STE) function, the forward pass is essentially an identity operation, meaning the output is the same as the input. However, we also need to save the `grad_fn` for use in the backward pass.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `forward` function:\n\n```python\n@staticmethod\ndef forward(ctx: Any, input: Tensor, output: Tensor, grad_fn: Optional[Callable[..., Any]] = None) -> Tensor:\n    # Save the grad_fn for use in the backward pass\n    ctx.grad_fn = grad_fn\n    \n    # The forward pass is essentially an identity operation\n    # Return the output tensor as is\n    return output\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Context Saving**: The `ctx` object is used to store information that you will need in the backward pass. Here, we store the `grad_fn` in `ctx` so that it can be accessed later during the backward computation.\n\n2. **Identity Operation**: The forward pass of the STE function is an identity operation, meaning the output is the same as the input. In this case, the function is designed to return the `output` tensor directly.\n\n3. **Return Statement**: The function returns the `output` tensor, which is the result of the forward pass.\n\nThis implementation sets up the necessary context for the backward pass, where the custom gradient behavior will be defined. The backward function will use the saved `grad_fn` to modify the gradients as needed.",
    "prompt": "Write the forward function for following class : \nclass STEFunction(Function):\n    \"\"\"Straight-Through Estimation (STE) function.\n\n    STE bridges the gradients between the input tensor and output tensor as if the function\n    was an identity function.
