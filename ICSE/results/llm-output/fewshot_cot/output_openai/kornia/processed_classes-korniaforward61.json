    "result": "To implement the `forward` method for the `DiceLoss` class, we need to compute the S\u00f8rensen-Dice Coefficient loss for multi-class segmentation tasks. The method should handle both 'micro' and 'macro' reduction methods, include numerical stability with `eps`, and support class weighting with `weight`. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass DiceLoss(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, average: str = \"micro\", eps: float = 1e-8, weight: Optional[Tensor] = None) -> None:\n        super(DiceLoss, self).__init__()\n        self.average = average\n        self.eps = eps\n        self.weight = weight\n\n    def forward(self, pred: Tensor, target: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        \"\"\"\n        Compute the Dice loss.\n\n        Args:\n            pred (Tensor): Predicted scores with shape (N, C, H, W) where N is batch size, \n                           C is number of classes, H and W are height and width.\n            target (Tensor): Ground truth labels with shape (N, H, W).\n\n        Returns:\n            Tensor: Computed Dice loss.\n        \"\"\"\n        # 1. Convert target to one-hot encoding\n        num_classes = pred.shape[1]\n        target_one_hot = torch.nn.functional.one_hot(target, num_classes=num_classes).permute(0, 3, 1, 2)\n\n        # 2. Flatten the predictions and target for each class\n        pred_flat = pred.view(pred.size(0), pred.size(1), -1)\n        target_flat = target_one_hot.view(target_one_hot.size(0), target_one_hot.size(1), -1)\n\n        # 3. Compute intersection and union\n        intersection = (pred_flat * target_flat).sum(dim=2)\n        union = pred_flat.sum(dim=2) + target_flat.sum(dim=2)\n\n        # 4. Compute Dice score\n        dice_score = (2.0 * intersection + self.eps) / (union + self.eps)\n\n        # 5. Apply class weights if provided\n        if self.weight is not None:\n            dice_score = dice_score * self.weight\n\n        # 6. Compute Dice loss\n        dice_loss = 1.0 - dice_score\n\n        # 7. Reduce the loss based on the specified average method\n        if self.average == 'micro':\n            # Micro: average over all classes and samples\n            loss = dice_loss.mean()\n        elif self.average == 'macro':\n            # Macro: average over classes, then average over samples\n            loss = dice_loss.mean(dim=0).mean()\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid average method: {self.average}. Choose 'micro' or 'macro'.\")\n\n        return loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **One-hot Encoding**: The ground truth `target` is converted to a one-hot encoded tensor to match the shape of `pred`.\n\n2. **Flattening**: Both `pred` and `target_one_hot` are flattened along the spatial dimensions to simplify the computation of intersection and union.\n\n3. **Intersection and Union**: The intersection and union are computed for each class.\n\n4. **Dice Score**: The Dice score is calculated using the formula \\((2 \\times \\text{intersection} + \\text{eps}) / (\\text{union} + \\text{eps})\\) to ensure numerical stability.\n\n5. **Class Weights**: If class weights are provided, they are applied to the Dice scores.\n\n6. **Dice Loss**: The Dice loss is computed as \\(1 - \\text{Dice score}\\).\n\n7. **Reduction**: The loss is reduced using either 'micro' or 'macro' averaging, as specified by the `average` parameter.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `forward` for the `DiceLoss` class that computes the S\u00f8rensen-Dice Coefficient loss for multi-class segmentation tasks. The method should take as input the predicted scores `pred` and the ground truth labels `target`, and return the computed Dice loss. The method should support two reduction methods: `'micro'` (calculates the loss across all classes) and `'macro'` (calculates the loss for each class separately and averages the loss across classes). The loss should also include options for numerical stability with `eps` and class weighting with `weight`.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass DiceLoss(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, average: str = \"micro\", eps: float = 1e-8, weight: Optional[Tensor] = None) -> None:\n        self.average = average\n        self.eps = eps\n        self.weight = weight\n\n    def forward(self, pred: Tensor, target: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
