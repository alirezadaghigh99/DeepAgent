    "result": "To implement the `backward` function for the `STEFunction` class, we need to define how the gradients are propagated back through the function during the backward pass. The `backward` function should return a tuple of gradients corresponding to each input of the `forward` function. In this case, the inputs are `input`, `output`, and `grad_fn`.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `backward` function:\n\n```python\n    @staticmethod\n    def backward(ctx: Any, grad_output: Tensor) -> Tuple[Tensor, Tensor, None]:\n        # Retrieve the gradient function from the context\n        grad_fn = ctx.grad_fn\n\n        # If a gradient function is provided, apply it to the grad_output\n        if grad_fn is not None:\n            grad_input = grad_fn(grad_output)\n        else:\n            # If no gradient function is provided, pass the gradient through unchanged\n            grad_input = grad_output\n\n        # The gradient with respect to the output is None because the output is not a leaf variable\n        grad_output_tensor = None\n\n        # Return the gradients for each input: input, output, and grad_fn\n        return grad_input, grad_output_tensor, None\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Retrieve the Gradient Function**: The `grad_fn` is retrieved from the context (`ctx`) which was saved during the `forward` pass.\n\n2. **Apply the Gradient Function**: If a `grad_fn` is provided, it is applied to `grad_output` to modify the gradient. This allows for custom gradient transformations, such as clamping the gradient values.\n\n3. **Pass Through the Gradient**: If no `grad_fn` is provided, the gradient is passed through unchanged, effectively making the function act as an identity function for the backward pass.\n\n4. **Return the Gradients**: The function returns a tuple of gradients corresponding to each input of the `forward` method. The gradient for `output` is `None` because it is not a leaf variable and does not require a gradient. The third element in the tuple is also `None` because `grad_fn` is not a tensor and does not require a gradient.",
