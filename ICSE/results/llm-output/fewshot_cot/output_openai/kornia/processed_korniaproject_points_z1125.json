    "result": "To create the `project_points_z1` function, we need to project 3D points from the camera frame onto the canonical z=1 plane using perspective division. The function will take a tensor of points with shape `(..., 3)` and return a tensor with shape `(..., 2)`. Here's a step-by-step implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef project_points_z1(points_in_camera: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Projects points from the camera frame into the canonical z=1 plane through perspective division.\n\n    Args:\n        points_in_camera (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (..., 3) representing the points to project.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: A tensor of shape (..., 2) representing the projected points.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Ensure the input tensor has the correct shape (..., 3)\n    if points_in_camera.shape[-1] != 3:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input tensor must have shape (..., 3)\")\n\n    # 2. Extract the x, y, and z components from the input tensor\n    x, y, z = points_in_camera[..., 0], points_in_camera[..., 1], points_in_camera[..., 2]\n\n    # 3. Check the precondition that z > 0\n    if torch.any(z <= 0):\n        raise ValueError(\"All points must have z > 0 to be in front of the camera\")\n\n    # 4. Perform perspective division to project onto the z=1 plane\n    x_proj = x / z\n    y_proj = y / z\n\n    # 5. Stack the projected x and y components to form the output tensor\n    projected_points = torch.stack((x_proj, y_proj), dim=-1)\n\n    # 6. Return the projected points\n    return projected_points\n\n# Example usage\npoints = torch.tensor([1., 2., 3.])\nprint(project_points_z1(points))  # Output: tensor([0.3333, 0.6667])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the input tensor has the correct shape, ensuring the last dimension is 3, which represents the x, y, and z coordinates.\n\n2. **Component Extraction**: The x, y, and z components are extracted from the input tensor.\n\n3. **Precondition Check**: The function checks if all z values are greater than 0, as required by the precondition. If any z value is less than or equal to 0, an error is raised.\n\n4. **Perspective Division**: The x and y components are divided by the z component to project the points onto the z=1 plane.\n\n5. **Output Construction**: The projected x and y components are stacked to form the output tensor with shape `(..., 2)`.\n\n6. **Return**: The function returns the projected points.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called project_points_z1 that projects one or more points from the camera frame into the canonical z=1 plane through perspective division. The input is a tensor called points_in_camera with shape (..., 3) representing the points to project. The function has a precondition that the points are in front of the camera (z > 0). If this is not the case, the points will be projected to the canonical plane, but the resulting points will be behind the camera and may cause numerical issues for z == 0. The output is a tensor representing the projected points with shape (..., 2). An example usage of the function is as follows:\n\n```python\npoints = torch.tensor([1., 2., 3.])\nproject_points_z1(points)\n```\n\nThis will return a tensor with values [0.3333, 0.6667].",
