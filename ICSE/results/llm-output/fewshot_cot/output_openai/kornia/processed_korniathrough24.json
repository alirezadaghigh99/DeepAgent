    "result": "To create the `through` method within the `ParametrizedLine` class, we need to follow a series of steps to ensure that the method correctly constructs a parameterized line between two points, `p0` and `p1`. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\nclass ParametrizedLine:\n    def __init__(self, point: torch.Tensor, direction: torch.Tensor):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize a ParametrizedLine with a point and a direction vector.\n\n        Args:\n            point (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, D) representing a point on the line.\n            direction (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, D) representing the direction of the line.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.point = point\n        self.direction = direction\n\n    @classmethod\n    def through(cls, p0: torch.Tensor, p1: torch.Tensor) -> 'ParametrizedLine':\n        \"\"\"\n        Create a ParametrizedLine through two points, p0 and p1.\n\n        Args:\n            p0 (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, D) representing the starting point.\n            p1 (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, D) representing the ending point.\n\n        Returns:\n            ParametrizedLine: An instance of ParametrizedLine representing the line through p0 and p1.\n        \"\"\"\n        # 1. Calculate the direction vector from p0 to p1\n        direction = p1 - p0\n\n        # 2. Normalize the direction vector\n        direction_norm = torch.norm(direction, dim=1, keepdim=True)\n        normalized_direction = direction / direction_norm\n\n        # 3. Return an instance of ParametrizedLine with p0 as the point and the normalized direction\n        return cls(point=p0, direction=normalized_direction)\n\n# Example usage:\n# p0 and p1 are tensors of shape (B, D)\np0 = torch.tensor([[0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0]])\np1 = torch.tensor([[1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 2.0]])\n\nline = ParametrizedLine.through(p0, p1)\nprint(\"Point on the line:\", line.point)\nprint(\"Direction of the line:\", line.direction)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Calculate the Direction Vector**: The direction vector is computed by subtracting `p0` from `p1`. This gives the vector pointing from `p0` to `p1`.\n\n2. **Normalize the Direction Vector**: The direction vector is normalized to ensure it has a unit length. This is done by dividing the direction vector by its norm (magnitude).\n\n3. **Return an Instance of `ParametrizedLine`**: The method returns a new instance of `ParametrizedLine` with `p0` as the point on the line and the normalized direction vector.\n\nThis method is useful for creating lines in a parameterized form, which is often required in geometry-related tasks such as computer graphics or physics simulations.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python method `through` within the `ParametrizedLine` class that constructs a parametrized line between two points, `p0` and `p1`. Both `p0` and `p1` are tensors of shape `(B, D)`, where `B` is the batch size and `D` is the dimensionality of the points. The method should return an instance of `ParametrizedLine` by calculating the direction vector from `p0` to `p1` and normalizing it. This method is useful in geometry-related tasks, such as computer graphics or physics simulations, where representing and working with lines in a parameterized form is necessary.",
