    "result": "To create the `unproject_points_z1` function, we need to transform points from a 2D plane (z=1) into a 3D space using the provided depth information. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef unproject_points_z1(points_in_cam_canonical: torch.Tensor, extension: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Unprojects points from the canonical z=1 plane into the camera frame.\n\n    Args:\n        points_in_cam_canonical (Tensor): Tensor of shape (..., 2) representing the points to unproject.\n        extension (Tensor, optional): Tensor of shape (..., 1) representing the depth of the points. Defaults to None.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor: Unprojected points with shape (..., 3).\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Check the shape of points_in_cam_canonical to ensure it's (..., 2)\n    if points_in_cam_canonical.shape[-1] != 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"points_in_cam_canonical must have shape (..., 2)\")\n\n    # 2. If extension is not provided, assume a default depth of 1 for all points\n    if extension is None:\n        extension = torch.ones(*points_in_cam_canonical.shape[:-1], 1, dtype=points_in_cam_canonical.dtype, device=points_in_cam_canonical.device)\n\n    # 3. Check the shape of extension to ensure it's (..., 1)\n    if extension.shape[-1] != 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"extension must have shape (..., 1)\")\n\n    # 4. Concatenate the points with the extension to form the unprojected points\n    unprojected_points = torch.cat((points_in_cam_canonical, extension), dim=-1)\n\n    # 5. Return the unprojected points\n    return unprojected_points\n\n# Example usage:\npoints = torch.tensor([[0.5, 0.5], [1.0, 1.0]])\nextension = torch.tensor([[2.0], [3.0]])\nunprojected_points = unproject_points_z1(points, extension)\nprint(unprojected_points)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the input `points_in_cam_canonical` has the correct shape (..., 2). If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Default Depth Handling**: If the `extension` tensor is not provided, the function assumes a default depth of 1 for all points. This is done by creating a tensor of ones with the appropriate shape.\n\n3. **Shape Validation for Extension**: The function checks if the `extension` tensor has the correct shape (..., 1). If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n4. **Concatenation**: The function concatenates the 2D points with the depth information to form 3D points. This is done using `torch.cat` along the last dimension.\n\n5. **Return**: Finally, the function returns the unprojected 3D points.\n\nThis function allows you to transform 2D points on a canonical plane into 3D space using the provided depth information.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called unproject_points_z1 that unprojects one or more points from the canonical z=1 plane into the camera frame. The function takes in a Tensor called points_in_cam_canonical representing the points to unproject with shape (..., 2) and an optional Tensor called extension representing the extension (depth) of the points with shape (..., 1). The function returns a Tensor representing the unprojected points with shape (..., 3). An example usage of the function is provided where points and extension are tensors, and the output is a tensor of unprojected points.",
