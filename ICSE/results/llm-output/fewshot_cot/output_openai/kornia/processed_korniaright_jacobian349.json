    "result": "To create a function called `right_jacobian` that computes the right Jacobian of SO(3), we can follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples provided. The function will use the `vector_to_skew_symmetric_matrix` function, `torch.norm`, `torch.eye`, and matrix multiplication to calculate the right Jacobian matrix. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef vector_to_skew_symmetric_matrix(vec):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert a vector of shape (3,) to a skew-symmetric matrix of shape (3, 3).\n    \"\"\"\n    zero = torch.tensor(0.0, device=vec.device, dtype=vec.dtype)\n    return torch.tensor([\n        [zero, -vec[2], vec[1]],\n        [vec[2], zero, -vec[0]],\n        [-vec[1], vec[0], zero]\n    ], device=vec.device, dtype=vec.dtype)\n\ndef right_jacobian(vec):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the right Jacobian of SO(3) for a given vector.\n\n    Args:\n        vec (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, 3) representing the input vectors.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: A tensor of shape (B, 3, 3) representing the right Jacobian matrices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Compute the norm of each vector in the batch\n    theta = torch.norm(vec, dim=1, keepdim=True)\n\n    # 2. Create an identity matrix of shape (3, 3)\n    I = torch.eye(3, device=vec.device, dtype=vec.dtype)\n\n    # 3. Initialize an empty tensor to store the right Jacobian matrices\n    right_jacobians = torch.empty((vec.shape[0], 3, 3), device=vec.device, dtype=vec.dtype)\n\n    # 4. Loop over each vector in the batch\n    for i in range(vec.shape[0]):\n        # 5. Compute the skew-symmetric matrix for the current vector\n        skew_symmetric = vector_to_skew_symmetric_matrix(vec[i])\n\n        # 6. Compute the right Jacobian matrix using the formula\n        if theta[i] < 1e-6:\n            # Use first-order Taylor expansion for small angles\n            right_jacobian_matrix = I - 0.5 * skew_symmetric\n        else:\n            # Use the full formula for larger angles\n            theta_i = theta[i].item()\n            A = torch.sin(theta_i) / theta_i\n            B = (1 - torch.cos(theta_i)) / (theta_i ** 2)\n            right_jacobian_matrix = I - A * skew_symmetric + B * (skew_symmetric @ skew_symmetric)\n\n        # 7. Store the computed right Jacobian matrix\n        right_jacobians[i] = right_jacobian_matrix\n\n    # 8. Return the tensor containing all right Jacobian matrices\n    return right_jacobians\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input and Output**: The function takes a batch of vectors `vec` of shape `(B, 3)` and returns a batch of right Jacobian matrices of shape `(B, 3, 3)`.\n\n2. **Norm Calculation**: The norm of each vector is calculated using `torch.norm`.\n\n3. **Identity Matrix**: An identity matrix `I` is created for use in the Jacobian calculation.\n\n4. **Loop Over Batch**: The function iterates over each vector in the batch to compute its corresponding right Jacobian matrix.\n\n5. **Skew-Symmetric Matrix**: The `vector_to_skew_symmetric_matrix` function is used to convert each vector into a skew-symmetric matrix.\n\n6. **Jacobian Calculation**: The right Jacobian is calculated using a formula that depends on the norm of the vector. For small angles, a Taylor expansion is used to avoid numerical instability.\n\n7. **Storage and Return**: The computed Jacobian matrices are stored in a tensor and returned.",
