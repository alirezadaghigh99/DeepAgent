    "result": "Creating a function to perform JPEG encoding on a batch of RGB images involves several steps, including color space conversion, downsampling, discrete cosine transform (DCT), quantization, and encoding. Below is a step-by-step outline of how you might implement such a function in Python. Note that this is a high-level overview and does not include the actual implementation of each step, as JPEG encoding is quite complex and typically handled by specialized libraries.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\ndef _jpeg_encode(\n    image_rgb: torch.Tensor,\n    jpeg_quality: torch.Tensor,\n    quantization_table_y: torch.Tensor,\n    quantization_table_c: torch.Tensor\n) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform JPEG encoding on a batch of RGB images.\n\n    Args:\n        image_rgb (Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, 3, H, W) representing a batch of RGB images.\n        jpeg_quality (Tensor): A tensor of shape (B) representing the JPEG compression quality for each image.\n        quantization_table_y (Tensor): Quantization table for the Y (luminance) channel.\n        quantization_table_c (Tensor): Quantization table for the Cb and Cr (chrominance) channels.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple[Tensor, Tensor, Tensor]: Encoded Y, Cb, and Cr components.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
