    "result": "To create the `project_points_orthographic` function, we will follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples provided. The function will project points from the camera frame onto the canonical \\( z=1 \\) plane using orthographic projection. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef project_points_orthographic(points_in_camera: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Project one or more points from the camera frame into the canonical z=1 plane\n    through orthographic projection.\n\n    Args:\n        points_in_camera (Tensor): Tensor of shape (..., 3) representing the points to project.\n                                   The last dimension should have size 3, corresponding to (x, y, z).\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor: Tensor of shape (..., 2) representing the projected points in the (u, v) plane.\n\n    Example:\n        >>> points = torch.tensor([1., 2., 3.])\n        >>> project_points_orthographic(points)\n        tensor([1., 2.])\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Ensure the input tensor has the correct shape\n    if points_in_camera.shape[-1] != 3:\n        raise ValueError(\"The last dimension of points_in_camera must be 3, representing (x, y, z).\")\n\n    # 2. Extract the x and y coordinates from the input tensor\n    x = points_in_camera[..., 0]\n    y = points_in_camera[..., 1]\n\n    # 3. Stack the x and y coordinates to form the projected points\n    projected_points = torch.stack((x, y), dim=-1)\n\n    # 4. Return the projected points\n    return projected_points\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: We first check if the last dimension of the input tensor `points_in_camera` is 3, which corresponds to the (x, y, z) coordinates. If not, we raise a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Extract Coordinates**: We extract the x and y coordinates from the input tensor. This is done using tensor slicing.\n\n3. **Stack Coordinates**: We use `torch.stack` to combine the x and y coordinates into a new tensor representing the projected points in the (u, v) plane.\n\n4. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the tensor containing the projected points.\n\nThis function can handle both single points and batches of points, as long as the last dimension of the input tensor is 3.",
