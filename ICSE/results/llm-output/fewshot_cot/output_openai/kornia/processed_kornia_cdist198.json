This is a placeholder, as the actual check would depend on the specific environment and hardware capabilities.\n\n2. **Using `torch.cdist`**: If the tensors are not MPS safe, the function uses `torch.cdist` directly to compute the pairwise distances.\n\n3. **Manual Computation**:\n   - **Squared Norms**: The squared norms of each tensor are computed using `torch.sum`.\n   - **Matrix Multiplication**: The function performs matrix multiplication between `d1` and the transpose of `d2` to compute the pairwise dot products.\n   - **Distance Calculation**: The squared distances are calculated by adding the squared norms and subtracting twice the dot products.\n   - **Clamping and Square Root**: The squared distances are clamped to ensure non-negative values, and the square root is taken to obtain the Euclidean distances.\n\n4. **Return**: The function returns the computed distance matrix.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `_cdist` that:\n\n- Takes two parameters:\n  - `d1`: A tensor.\n  - `d2`: Another tensor.\n- The function calculates the pairwise Euclidean distance between `d1` and `d2` similar to `torch.cdist`.\n- If both tensors are not safe for Metal Performance Shaders (MPS), the function will use `torch.cdist` directly.\n- Otherwise, the function manually computes the Euclidean distances using matrix operations:\n  - Computes the squared distance for each tensor.\n  - Repeats the squared distances and performs matrix multiplication.\n  - Clamps the result to a minimum of 0.0 and takes the square root to get the final distances.\n- Returns the computed distance matrix.",
