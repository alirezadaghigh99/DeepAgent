    "result": "To create a function that extracts image patches from a pyramid of images based on input Local Affine Frames (LAFs), we need to follow a structured approach. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef extract_patches_from_pyramid(img: torch.Tensor, laf: torch.Tensor, patch_size: int, normalize_lafs: bool = False) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Extract image patches from a pyramid of images based on input Local Affine Frames (LAFs).\n\n    Args:\n        img (torch.Tensor): Image tensor of shape (B, CH, H, W).\n        laf (torch.Tensor): LAFs of shape (B, N, 2, 3).\n        patch_size (int): Size of the patches to extract (PS).\n        normalize_lafs (bool): Whether to normalize the LAFs before extraction.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: Extracted patches of shape (B, N, CH, PS, PS).\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Validate input dimensions\n    B, CH, H, W = img.shape\n    _, N, _, _ = laf.shape\n\n    # 2. Optionally normalize LAFs\n    if normalize_lafs:\n        laf = normalize_lafs_function(laf)  # Define this function if needed\n\n    # 3. Create an image pyramid\n    pyramid = create_image_pyramid(img)  # Define this function to create a pyramid\n\n    # 4. Initialize a tensor to hold the extracted patches\n    patches = torch.zeros((B, N, CH, patch_size, patch_size), dtype=img.dtype, device=img.device)\n\n    # 5. Loop over each batch and each LAF\n    for b in range(B):\n        for n in range(N):\n            # 6. Extract the LAF parameters\n            A = laf[b, n, :, :2]  # Affine transformation matrix\n            t = laf[b, n, :, 2]   # Translation vector\n\n            # 7. Determine the appropriate pyramid level based on the scale of the LAF\n            scale = torch.sqrt(torch.det(A))\n            level = determine_pyramid_level(scale, pyramid)  # Define this function\n\n            # 8. Extract the patch from the appropriate pyramid level\n            patch = extract_patch_from_level(pyramid[level][b], A, t, patch_size)\n\n            # 9. Store the extracted patch\n            patches[b, n] = patch\n\n    return patches\n\ndef normalize_lafs_function(laf: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    # Implement normalization logic if needed\n    return laf\n\ndef create_image_pyramid(img: torch.Tensor) -> list:\n    # Implement logic to create an image pyramid\n    # For example, using Gaussian pyramids\n    pyramid = [img]\n    for _ in range(1, 5):  # Example: 5 levels\n        img = F.interpolate(img, scale_factor=0.5, mode='bilinear', align_corners=False)\n        pyramid.append(img)\n    return pyramid\n\ndef determine_pyramid_level(scale: torch.Tensor, pyramid: list) -> int:\n    # Implement logic to determine the pyramid level based on the scale\n    # For simplicity, assume a direct mapping\n    return min(int(scale.item()), len(pyramid) - 1)\n\ndef extract_patch_from_level(img: torch.Tensor, A: torch.Tensor, t: torch.Tensor, patch_size: int) -> torch.Tensor:\n    # Implement logic to extract a patch from the given pyramid level\n    # Use affine transformations and grid sampling\n    grid = F.affine_grid(A.unsqueeze(0), [1, img.size(0), patch_size, patch_size], align_corners=False)\n    patch = F.grid_sample(img.unsqueeze(0), grid, align_corners=False)\n    return patch.squeeze(0)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: Ensure the input tensors have the expected dimensions.\n\n2. **Normalization**: Optionally normalize the LAFs if required.\n\n3. **Image Pyramid**: Create a pyramid of images to handle different scales. This can be done using downsampling techniques like Gaussian pyramids.\n\n4. **Patch Extraction**: For each LAF, determine the appropriate pyramid level based on the scale, and extract the patch using affine transformations.\n\n5. **Affine Transformations**: Use PyTorch's `affine_grid` and `grid_sample` to apply the affine transformation and extract the patch.\n\n6. **Return**: Return the tensor containing all extracted patches.\n\nThis function is designed to be flexible and handle various cases, such as when no patches need to be extracted at a particular pyramid level. You may need to adjust the logic for determining pyramid levels and normalization based on your specific requirements.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function that extracts image patches from a pyramid of images based on input Local Affine Frames (LAFs). The function should take as input an image tensor `img` of shape `(B, CH, H, W)` and LAFs `laf` of shape `(B, N, 2, 3)`. Optionally, normalize the LAFs before extraction. The function should return a tensor of extracted patches of shape `(B, N, CH, PS, PS)`. The extraction should be done at the appropriate pyramid level based on the scale of each LAF. Ensure that the function handles various cases, such as when no patches need to be extracted at a particular pyramid level.",
