    "result": "To implement the `get_perspective_transform` function using the Direct Linear Transform (DLT) algorithm, we need to calculate the perspective transformation matrix that maps a set of four source points to a set of four destination points. Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing this function in Python:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef get_perspective_transform(points_src: torch.Tensor, points_dst: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate a perspective transform from four pairs of corresponding points using the Direct Linear Transform (DLT).\n\n    Args:\n        points_src: coordinates of quadrangle vertices in the source image with shape (B, 4, 2).\n        points_dst: coordinates of the corresponding quadrangle vertices in the destination image with shape (B, 4, 2).\n\n    Returns:\n        The perspective transformation with shape (B, 3, 3).\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Ensure the input tensors are of the correct shape\n    assert points_src.shape == points_dst.shape, \"Source and destination points must have the same shape.\"\n    assert points_src.shape[1:] == (4, 2), \"Each set of points must have shape (4, 2).\"\n\n    # 2. Extract the batch size\n    batch_size = points_src.shape[0]\n\n    # 3. Initialize the matrix to hold the perspective transformations\n    transforms = torch.zeros((batch_size, 3, 3), dtype=points_src.dtype, device=points_src.device)\n\n    # 4. Loop over each set of points in the batch\n    for i in range(batch_size):\n        src = points_src[i]\n        dst = points_dst[i]\n\n        # 5. Construct the matrix A for the DLT algorithm\n        A = []\n        for j in range(4):\n            x_src, y_src = src[j]\n            x_dst, y_dst = dst[j]\n            A.append([-x_src, -y_src, -1, 0, 0, 0, x_dst * x_src, x_dst * y_src, x_dst])\n            A.append([0, 0, 0, -x_src, -y_src, -1, y_dst * x_src, y_dst * y_src, y_dst])\n\n        A = torch.tensor(A, dtype=points_src.dtype, device=points_src.device)\n\n        # 6. Compute the singular value decomposition of A\n        U, S, Vt = torch.linalg.svd(A)\n\n        # 7. The last row of Vt (or the last column of V) gives the solution\n        H = Vt[-1].reshape(3, 3)\n\n        # 8. Normalize the matrix so that the bottom-right value is 1\n        H /= H[2, 2]\n\n        # 9. Store the transformation matrix\n        transforms[i] = H\n\n    # 10. Return the batch of perspective transformation matrices\n    return transforms\n\n# Example usage\nx1 = torch.tensor([[[0., 0.], [1., 0.], [1., 1.], [0., 1.]]])\nx2 = torch.tensor([[[1., 0.], [0., 0.], [0., 1.], [1., 1.]]])\nx2_trans_x1 = get_perspective_transform(x1, x2)\nprint(x2_trans_x1)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: We first ensure that the input tensors have the correct shape and that the source and destination points have the same shape.\n\n2. **Batch Processing**: The function is designed to handle a batch of point sets, so we loop over each set in the batch.\n\n3. **Matrix Construction**: For each set of points, we construct the matrix \\( A \\) used in the DLT algorithm. This matrix is constructed from the source and destination points.\n\n4. **SVD and Solution Extraction**: We use singular value decomposition (SVD) to solve the system of equations. The solution is found in the last row of the \\( V^T \\) matrix from the SVD.\n\n5. **Normalization**: The resulting transformation matrix is normalized so that the bottom-right element is 1.\n\n6. **Output**: The function returns a batch of perspective transformation matrices.",
