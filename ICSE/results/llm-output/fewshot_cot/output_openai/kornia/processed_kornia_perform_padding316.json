    "result": "To implement the `_perform_padding` function, we need to ensure that the height (`H`) and width (`W`) of the image are both divisible by 16. This involves calculating the necessary padding for each dimension and then applying it to the image. Here's a step-by-step implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\n\ndef _perform_padding(image: Tensor) -> tuple[Tensor, int, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Pads a given image to be divisible by 16.\n\n    Args:\n        image: Image of the shape (*, 3, H, W).\n\n    Returns:\n        image_padded: Padded image of the shape (*, 3, H_new, W_new).\n        h_pad: Padded pixels along the horizontal axis.\n        w_pad: Padded pixels along the vertical axis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Extract the height (H) and width (W) of the image\n    _, _, H, W = image.shape\n\n    # 2. Calculate the padding needed for height and width to make them divisible by 16\n    h_pad = (16 - H % 16) % 16\n    w_pad = (16 - W % 16) % 16\n\n    # 3. Calculate the padding for each side\n    pad_top = h_pad // 2\n    pad_bottom = h_pad - pad_top\n    pad_left = w_pad // 2\n    pad_right = w_pad - pad_left\n\n    # 4. Apply padding to the image using torch's pad function\n    #    Padding format: (pad_left, pad_right, pad_top, pad_bottom)\n    image_padded = torch.nn.functional.pad(image, (pad_left, pad_right, pad_top, pad_bottom))\n\n    # 5. Return the padded image and the padding values\n    return image_padded, h_pad, w_pad\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Extract Dimensions**: We first extract the height (`H`) and width (`W`) of the image from its shape.\n2. **Calculate Padding**: We calculate how much padding is needed to make both dimensions divisible by 16. The modulo operation helps determine the remainder, and we adjust it to ensure divisibility.\n3. **Determine Padding for Each Side**: We split the padding equally between the top/bottom and left/right sides. If the padding is odd, the bottom and right sides get the extra pixel.\n4. **Apply Padding**: We use `torch.nn.functional.pad` to apply the calculated padding to the image.\n5. **Return**: Finally, we return the padded image along with the total padding applied to the height and width.",
