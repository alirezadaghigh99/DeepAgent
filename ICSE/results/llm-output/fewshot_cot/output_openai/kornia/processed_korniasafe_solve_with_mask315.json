    "result": "To implement the `safe_solve_with_mask` function as described, we need to ensure that it handles potential issues with singular matrices while solving the system of linear equations \\( AX = B \\). The function should also be compatible with different versions of PyTorch, particularly handling cases where the LU decomposition and solving methods might differ. Here's a step-by-step implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport warnings\n\ndef safe_solve_with_mask(B: torch.Tensor, A: torch.Tensor):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solve the system of linear equations AX = B safely, handling singular matrices.\n\n    Args:\n        B (Tensor): The right-hand side tensor in the equation AX = B.\n        A (Tensor): The matrix tensor that will be solved against B.\n\n    Returns:\n        X (Tensor): The solution tensor that satisfies AX = B.\n        A_LU (Tensor): The LU decomposition of matrix A.\n        valid_mask (Tensor): A boolean tensor indicating which rows were solved successfully.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Ensure B is a tensor\n    assert isinstance(B, torch.Tensor), \"B must be a torch.Tensor\"\n\n    # 2. Cast B to float32 if it's not float32 or float64\n    if B.dtype not in [torch.float32, torch.float64]:\n        B = B.to(torch.float32)\n\n    # 3. Check PyTorch version for compatibility\n    pytorch_version = torch.__version__.split('.')\n    major_version = int(pytorch_version[0])\n    minor_version = int(pytorch_version[1])\n\n    # 4. Initialize valid_mask as all True\n    valid_mask = torch.ones(B.size(0), dtype=torch.bool, device=B.device)\n\n    # 5. Solve the system using LU decomposition\n    try:\n        if major_version > 1 or (major_version == 1 and minor_version >= 10):\n            # Use torch.linalg.lu_factor and lu_solve for PyTorch >= 1.10\n            A_LU, pivots = torch.linalg.lu_factor(A)\n            X = torch.linalg.lu_solve(A_LU, pivots, B)\n        else:\n            # Fallback for older versions\n            warnings.warn(\"Using fallback method for PyTorch < 1.10; valid_mask may not be accurate.\")\n            X, _ = torch.solve(B, A)\n            A_LU = None  # LU decomposition not available in older versions\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        # 6.

Return the solution, LU decomposition, and valid mask\n    return X, A_LU, valid_mask\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation and Casting:**\n   - Ensure `B` is a tensor and cast it to `float32` if necessary for compatibility with PyTorch's linear algebra functions.\n\n2. **Version Compatibility:**\n   - Check the PyTorch version to decide which method to use for solving the system. PyTorch 1.10 and later have `torch.linalg.lu_factor` and `torch.linalg.lu_solve`, which are preferred for numerical stability.\n\n3. **LU Decomposition and Solving:**\n   - Use LU decomposition to solve the system. If the PyTorch version is older, fall back to `torch.solve`.\n\n4. **Error Handling:**\n   - Catch runtime errors related to singular matrices and set the `valid_mask` to `False` for those cases, returning a zero tensor for `X`.\n\n5. **Output:**\n   - Return the solution `X`, the LU decomposition `A_LU`, and the `valid_mask` indicating which solutions are valid.",
    "prompt": "Write a python function The `safe_solve_with_mask` function is designed to solve a system of linear equations \\( AX = B \\) while handling potential issues related to singular matrices. The function provides a safe mechanism to avoid crashes due to singular matrices by returning a mask that indicates valid solutions. Here's a breakdown of the input, output, and error handling:\n\n### Input:\n- **`B` (Tensor):** The right-hand side tensor in the equation \\( AX = B \\).\n- **`A` (Tensor):** The matrix tensor that will be solved against \\( B \\).\n\n### Output:\n- **`X` (Tensor):** The solution tensor that satisfies \\( AX = B \\), or a closest approximation if the matrix is near-singular.\n- **`A_LU` (Tensor):** The LU decomposition of matrix `A`, which is useful for numerical stability.\n- **`valid_mask` (Tensor):** A boolean tensor indicating which rows of the batch were solved successfully (i.e., without encountering a singular matrix).\n\n### Error Handling:\n- If the PyTorch version is less than 1.10, the function falls back to a different solution method (`_torch_solve_cast`) and issues a warning that the validity mask might not be correct.\n- If `B` is not a tensor, an `AssertionError` is raised.\n- If the data type of `B` is not `torch.float32` or `torch.float64`, it is cast to `torch.float32` for compatibility with the solution functions.\n- The function includes branches for compatibility with different PyTorch versions, ensuring that it can handle LU decomposition and solving in a way that is consistent with the PyTorch version in use.\n\nThis function is useful in scenarios where solving linear equations might encounter singular matrices, and you need a robust method to handle such cases gracefully.",
