    "prompt": "Create a Python function `run_7point` that computes the fundamental matrix using the 7-point algorithm. The function should:\n\n- Accept two sets of points (`points1`, `points2`) as input, each of shape `(B, N, 2)`, where `B` is the batch size, and `N` is the number of points (exactly 7).\n- Normalize the points, construct a linear system, and solve it using SVD to obtain two fundamental matrices.\n- Use these matrices to form a cubic polynomial, solve for its roots, and compute up to three potential fundamental matrices.\n- Handle edge cases where matrices might be non-invertible and ensure numerical stability.\n- Return the computed fundamental matrices in the shape `(B, 3*m, 3)`, where `m` can be 1, 2, or 3.\n\nErrors:\n- The function should raise `AssertionError` if the input tensors do not have the expected shapes.\n- Handle cases where matrix inversion is problematic, ensuring robust solutions are returned.",
