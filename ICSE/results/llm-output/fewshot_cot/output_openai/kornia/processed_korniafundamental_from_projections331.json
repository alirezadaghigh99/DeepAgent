    "result": "To create the `fundamental_from_projections` function, we need to follow a structured approach similar to the examples provided. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef fundamental_from_projections(P1: torch.Tensor, P2: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the fundamental matrix from two projection matrices.\n\n    Args:\n        P1 (Tensor): First projection matrix of shape (*, 3, 4).\n        P2 (Tensor): Second projection matrix of shape (*, 3, 4).\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor: Fundamental matrix of shape (*, 3, 3).\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Ensure the projection matrices have the correct shape\n    assert P1.shape[-2:] == (3, 4), \"P1 must have shape (*, 3, 4)\"\n    assert P2.shape[-2:] == (3, 4), \"P2 must have shape (*, 3, 4)\"\n    assert P1.shape[:-2] == P2.shape[:-2], \"P1 and P2 must have matching batch dimensions\"\n\n    # 2. Convert inputs to float32 if they are not float32 or float64\n    if P1.dtype not in (torch.float32, torch.float64):\n        P1 = P1.to(torch.float32)\n    if P2.dtype not in (torch.float32, torch.float64):\n        P2 = P2.to(torch.float32)\n\n    # 3. Initialize the fundamental matrix tensor\n    F = torch.zeros(P1.shape[:-1] + (3,), dtype=P1.dtype, device=P1.device)\n\n    # 4. Compute the fundamental matrix using determinants of submatrices\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            # Create submatrices by removing the i-th row from P1 and the j-th column from P2\n            P1_sub = torch.cat([P1[..., :i, :], P1[..., i+1:, :]], dim=-2)\n            P2_sub = torch.cat([P2[..., :, :j], P2[..., :, j+1:]], dim=-1)\n\n            # Compute the determinant of the submatrix\n            F[..., i, j] = torch.det(P1_sub @ P2_sub)\n\n    # 5. Return the computed fundamental matrix\n    return F\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Shape and Batch Dimension Check**: We first ensure that both `P1` and `P2` have the shape `(*, 3, 4)` and that their batch dimensions match. If not, an `AssertionError` is raised.\n\n2. **Data Type Conversion**: We convert the input tensors to `torch.float32` if they are not already in `float32` or `float64`. This ensures numerical stability and compatibility with PyTorch operations.\n\n3. **Initialize the Fundamental Matrix**: We create a tensor `F` to store the fundamental matrix, with the appropriate shape and data type.\n\n4. **Compute the Fundamental Matrix**: We iterate over the indices to compute the elements of the fundamental matrix. For each element `F[i, j]`, we remove the `i`-th row from `P1` and the `j`-th column from `P2`, compute the determinant of the resulting submatrix, and assign it to `F[i, j]`.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the computed fundamental matrix `F`.\n\nThis function should handle the computation of the fundamental matrix from two projection matrices efficiently, while ensuring the input constraints are met.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function named `fundamental_from_projections` that calculates the fundamental matrix from two projection matrices (`P1` and `P2`). The function should ensure that both projection matrices have the correct shape of `(*, 3, 4)` and matching batch dimensions, raising an `AssertionError` if these conditions are not met. The function computes the fundamental matrix using the determinants of specific submatrices derived from the input projections and returns a tensor of shape `(*, 3, 3)`. The function should handle different data types, converting the inputs to `torch.float32` if they are not already in `float32` or `float64`.",
