    "result": "To implement a differentiable and soft approximation of the clipping operation, we can use a smooth function that approximates the hard clipping operation. One common approach is to use a sigmoid function to smoothly transition between the clipped and unclipped regions. Here's a step-by-step implementation of such a function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef differentiable_clipping(input: torch.Tensor, min_val: Optional[float] = None, max_val: Optional[float] = None, scale: float = 0.02) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements a differentiable and soft approximation of the clipping operation.\n\n    Args:\n        input (Tensor): Input tensor of any shape.\n        min_val (Optional[float]): Minimum value.\n        max_val (Optional[float]): Maximum value.\n        scale (float): Scale value. Default 0.02.\n\n    Returns:\n        output (Tensor): Clipped output tensor of the same shape as the input tensor.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. If min_val is not specified, set it to negative infinity\n    if min_val is None:\n        min_val = float('-inf')\n    \n    # 2. If max_val is not specified, set it to positive infinity\n    if max_val is None:\n        max_val = float('inf')\n    \n    # 3. Compute the sigmoid-based soft clipping for the lower bound\n    lower_bound = min_val + F.sigmoid((input - min_val) / scale) * (input - min_val)\n    \n    # 4. Compute the sigmoid-based soft clipping for the upper bound\n    upper_bound = max_val - F.sigmoid((max_val - input) / scale) * (max_val - input)\n    \n    # 5. Combine the results to get the final output\n    output = torch.min(lower_bound, upper_bound)\n    \n    # 6. Return the clipped output tensor\n    return output\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Handling Optional Bounds**: If `min_val` or `max_val` is not provided, we set them to negative and positive infinity, respectively, to ensure that the clipping operation is only applied when bounds are specified.\n\n2. **Sigmoid-Based Clipping**: We use the sigmoid function to create a smooth transition between the clipped and unclipped regions. The sigmoid function is scaled by the `scale` parameter to control the sharpness of the transition.\n\n3. **Lower and Upper Bounds**: We compute the soft clipping for both the lower and upper bounds separately and then combine them using `torch.min` to ensure that the final output respects both bounds.\n\n4. **Output**: The function returns a tensor of the same shape as the input, with values softly clipped between `min_val` and `max_val`.",
