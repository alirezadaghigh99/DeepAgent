    "result": "To implement the `_compute_tiles` function, we need to follow a series of steps to ensure that the images are appropriately padded and then divided into tiles according to the specified grid size. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef _compute_tiles(images: torch.Tensor, grid_size: tuple, even_tile_size: bool = False) -> tuple:\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute tiles from a batch of 2D images.\n\n    Args:\n        images (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, C, H, W) representing the batch of images.\n        grid_size (tuple): A tuple (GH, GW) representing the number of tiles in height and width.\n        even_tile_size (bool): If True, ensures that the tiles have even dimensions.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing:\n            - tiles (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, GH, GW, C, TH, TW) with the computed tiles.\n            - padded_images (torch.Tensor): A tensor of the padded images.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Extract dimensions from the input tensor and grid size\n    B, C, H, W = images.shape\n    GH, GW = grid_size\n\n    # 2. Calculate the target tile size\n    TH = H // GH\n    TW = W // GW\n\n    # 3. Adjust tile size to be even if required\n    if even_tile_size:\n        TH += TH % 2\n        TW += TW % 2\n\n    # 4. Calculate the required padding\n    pad_h = max(0, GH * TH - H)\n    pad_w = max(0, GW * TW - W)\n\n    # 5. Pad the images if necessary\n    padded_images = F.pad(images, (0, pad_w, 0, pad_h))\n\n    # 6. Check if the grid size exceeds the image dimensions after padding\n    padded_H, padded_W = padded_images.shape[2], padded_images.shape[3]\n    if GH * TH > padded_H or GW * TW > padded_W:\n        raise ValueError(\"Grid size exceeds image dimensions after padding.\")\n\n    # 7. Reshape the padded images to extract tiles\n    tiles = padded_images.unfold(2, TH, TH).unfold(3, TW, TW)\n    tiles = tiles.permute(0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5)  # (B, GH, GW, C, TH, TW)\n\n    # 8. Return the tiles and the padded images\n    return tiles, padded_images\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Extract Dimensions**: We start by extracting the batch size, number of channels, and the height and width of the images from the input tensor.\n\n2. **Calculate Tile Size**: We determine the initial tile size by dividing the image dimensions by the grid size.\n\n3. **Adjust for Even Tile Size**: If `even_tile_size` is `True`, we adjust the tile dimensions to ensure they are even.\n\n4. **Calculate Padding**: We compute the necessary padding to ensure that the grid size fits perfectly into the image dimensions.\n\n5. **Pad Images**: We use `torch.nn.functional.pad` to pad the images as needed.\n\n6. **Check Grid Size**: We verify that the grid size does not exceed the padded image dimensions, raising a `ValueError` if it does.\n\n7. **Extract Tiles**: We use the `unfold` method to extract tiles from the padded images, and then permute the dimensions to get the desired shape.\n\n8. **Return**: Finally, we return the tiles and the padded images as a tuple.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function _compute_tiles that takes a batch of 2D images as a PyTorch tensor, a grid size tuple representing the number of tiles to crop in each direction, and an optional boolean even_tile_size to ensure the tiles have even dimensions. The function should return a tuple containing two tensors: one with the computed tiles and another with the padded batch of images. The tile tensor should have the shape (B, GH, GW, C, TH, TW), where B is the batch size. Ensure that the image is padded appropriately if the grid size does not perfectly fit the image dimensions. Raise a ValueError if the grid size exceeds the image dimensions after padding.",
