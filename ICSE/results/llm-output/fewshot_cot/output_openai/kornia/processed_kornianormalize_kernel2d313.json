    "result": "To complete the `normalize_kernel2d` function, we need to ensure that the input tensor, which represents a 2D kernel, is normalized. This typically involves ensuring that the sum of all elements in the kernel equals 1, which is common for smoothing kernels, or ensuring that the kernel has zero mean, which is common for derivative kernels. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\n\ndef normalize_kernel2d(input: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n    r\"\"\"Normalize both derivative and smoothing kernel.\"\"\"\n    # Ensure the input tensor has the correct shape\n    KORNIA_CHECK_SHAPE(input, [\"*\", \"H\", \"W\"])\n\n    # Compute the sum of the kernel elements\n    kernel_sum = input.sum()\n\n    # If the sum is not zero, normalize the kernel by dividing by the sum\n    if kernel_sum != 0:\n        input = input / kernel_sum\n\n    # Compute the mean of the kernel elements\n    kernel_mean = input.mean()\n\n    # Subtract the mean to ensure zero mean for derivative kernels\n    input = input - kernel_mean\n\n    return input\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Shape Check**: The function starts by checking the shape of the input tensor to ensure it matches the expected dimensions. This is done using the `KORNIA_CHECK_SHAPE` function, which is assumed to be a utility function provided by the Kornia library.\n\n2. **Normalization**: \n   - **Smoothing Kernel**: If the kernel is a smoothing kernel, its elements should sum to 1. This is achieved by dividing the entire kernel by its sum.\n   - **Derivative Kernel**: For derivative kernels, we often want them to have a zero mean. This is done by subtracting the mean of the kernel from each element.\n\n3. **Return**: The function returns the normalized kernel.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input tensor is a 2D kernel and that the `KORNIA_CHECK_SHAPE` function is available to verify the shape. Adjustments might be needed based on the specific requirements or additional context of the Kornia library.",
