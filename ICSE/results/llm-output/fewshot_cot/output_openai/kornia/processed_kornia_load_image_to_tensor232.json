    "result": "To create the `_load_image_to_tensor` function, we will follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples provided. This function will read an image file, decode it using Kornia's Rust backend, and convert it to a PyTorch tensor. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport torch\nimport kornia as K\nfrom kornia.io import load_image\n\ndef _load_image_to_tensor(path_file: Path, device: torch.device) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Load an image from a file, decode it using Kornia's Rust backend, and convert it to a PyTorch tensor.\n\n    Args:\n        path_file (Path): Path object pointing to a valid image file.\n        device (torch.device): The device where the image tensor should be placed.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: Image tensor with shape (3, H, W) on the specified device.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the image format is unsupported.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Check if the file exists and is a valid image file\n    if not path_file.is_file():\n        raise FileNotFoundError(f\"The file {path_file} does not exist.\")\n    \n    # 2. Load the image using Kornia's load_image function\n    try:\n        image = load_image(str(path_file), K.io.ImageLoadType.RGB32)\n    except Exception as e:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Failed to load image from {path_file}: {e}\")\n\n    # 3. Ensure the image is in the correct format (3 channels)\n    if image.shape[0] != 3:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Unsupported image format: expected 3 channels, got {image.shape[0]} channels.\")\n\n    # 4. Move the image tensor to the specified device\n    image = image.to(device)\n\n    # 5. Return the image tensor\n    return image\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **File Existence Check**: We first check if the provided `path_file` exists and is a file. If not, we raise a `FileNotFoundError`.\n\n2. **Image Loading**: We use Kornia's `load_image` function to load and decode the image. The `ImageLoadType.RGB32` ensures that the image is loaded as a 3-channel RGB image.\n\n3. **Channel Check**: We verify that the loaded image has 3 channels. If not, we raise a `ValueError`.\n\n4. **Device Transfer**: We move the image tensor to the specified device (CPU or GPU) using the `.to(device)` method.\n\n5. **Return**: Finally, we return the image tensor.\n\nThis function handles common image formats and ensures that the image is properly loaded and transferred to the desired device.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function `_load_image_to_tensor` that reads an image file from the specified `path_file`, decodes it using the Kornia Rust backend, and converts it to a PyTorch tensor. The function takes two inputs: `path_file`, which is a `Path` object pointing to a valid image file, and `device`, which specifies the device (e.g., CPU or GPU) where the image tensor should be placed. The function returns the image as a tensor with shape `(3, H, W)`, where `H` is the height and `W` is the width of the image. The function handles image files with `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and other supported formats, raising an error if the image format is unsupported. It also ensures that the resulting tensor is moved to the specified device.",
