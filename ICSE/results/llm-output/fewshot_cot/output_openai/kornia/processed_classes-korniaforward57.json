    "result": "To implement the `forward` method for the `AdjustHue` class, we need to adjust the hue of an RGB image tensor. The input tensor is expected to have pixel values in the range [0, 1] and a shape of `(*, 3, H, W)`, where `*` represents any number of leading dimensions (e.g., batch size).\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to implementing the `forward` method:\n\n1. **Convert RGB to HSV**: The hue adjustment is easier to perform in the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space. We'll first convert the RGB image to HSV.\n\n2. **Adjust the Hue**: Modify the hue channel by adding the `hue_factor`. The hue value is typically in the range [0, 1], so ensure that the adjusted hue wraps around correctly.\n\n3. **Convert HSV back to RGB**: After adjusting the hue, convert the image back to the RGB color space.\n\n4. **Return the Adjusted Image**: Return the adjusted image tensor.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom torchvision.transforms.functional import rgb_to_hsv, hsv_to_rgb\n\nclass AdjustHue(Module):\n    def __init__(self, hue_factor: float):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.hue_factor = hue_factor\n\n    def forward(self, input: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # 1. Convert the input RGB image to HSV\n        hsv_image = rgb_to_hsv(input)\n\n        # 2. Adjust the hue channel\n        h, s, v = hsv_image.unbind(dim=-3)\n        h = (h + self.hue_factor) % 1.0  # Ensure hue wraps around\n\n        # 3. Recombine the adjusted hue with the original saturation and value\n        adjusted_hsv = torch.stack((h, s, v), dim=-3)\n\n        # 4. Convert the adjusted HSV image back to RGB\n        adjusted_rgb = hsv_to_rgb(adjusted_hsv)\n\n        # 5. Return the adjusted RGB image\n        return adjusted_rgb\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **RGB to HSV Conversion**: We use `rgb_to_hsv` from `torchvision.transforms.functional` to convert the RGB image to HSV. This function expects the input to be in the range [0, 1].\n\n- **Hue Adjustment**: The hue channel is adjusted by adding the `hue_factor`. The modulo operation ensures that the hue value wraps around within the range [0, 1].\n\n- **HSV to RGB Conversion**: After adjusting the hue, we convert the HSV image back to RGB using `hsv_to_rgb`.\n\n- **Return**: The adjusted RGB image is returned as the output of the `forward` method.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the `hue_factor` is a float value that represents the amount by which to adjust the hue. The hue adjustment is cyclic, meaning that adding 1 to the hue results in the same color, so the modulo operation ensures the hue stays within the valid range.",
    "prompt": "**Task:** Write the `forward` method for the `AdjustHue` class. This method should adjust the hue of the input image tensor by a specified hue factor.\n**Class Context:**\n```python\nclass AdjustHue(Module):\n    def forward(self, input: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # Implement this function\n```\n- The method should apply the hue adjustment to the input tensor using the provided `hue_factor`.\n- The input tensor is expected to be an RGB image with pixel values in the range [0, 1] and of shape `(*, 3, H, W)`\nThis prompt instructs the user to implement the `forward` method for adjusting the hue of an image tensor using the provided `hue_factor`.",
