    "result": "To implement the `remap` function that applies a generic geometrical transformation to an image tensor, we can use PyTorch's `grid_sample` function. This function allows us to perform sampling on a grid, which is essentially what remapping involves. Here's a step-by-step implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef remap(image: torch.Tensor, map_x: torch.Tensor, map_y: torch.Tensor, mode: str = 'bilinear',\n          padding_mode: str = 'zeros', align_corners: bool = False, normalized_coordinates: bool = False) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Apply a generic geometrical transformation to an image tensor.\n\n    Args:\n        image: the tensor to remap with shape (B, C, H, W).\n        map_x: the flow in the x-direction in pixel coordinates with shape (B, H, W).\n        map_y: the flow in the y-direction in pixel coordinates with shape (B, H, W).\n        mode: interpolation mode to calculate output values 'bilinear' | 'nearest'.\n        padding_mode: padding mode for outside grid values 'zeros' | 'border' | 'reflection'.\n        align_corners: mode for grid_generation.\n        normalized_coordinates: whether the input coordinates are normalized in the range of [-1, 1].\n\n    Returns:\n        the warped tensor with the same shape as the input grid maps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Ensure map_x and map_y have the same shape\n    assert map_x.shape == map_y.shape, \"map_x and map_y must have the same shape\"\n\n    # 2. Get the batch size, height, and width from the map_x tensor\n    B, H, W = map_x.shape\n\n    # 3. Stack map_x and map_y to create a grid of shape (B, H, W, 2)\n    grid = torch.stack((map_x, map_y), dim=-1)\n\n    # 4. If coordinates are not normalized, convert them to the range [-1, 1]\n    if not normalized_coordinates:\n        grid[..., 0] = 2.0 * grid[..., 0] / (W - 1) - 1.0\n        grid[..., 1] = 2.0 * grid[..., 1] / (H - 1) - 1.0\n\n    # 5. Use grid_sample to apply the transformation\n    warped_image = F.grid_sample(image, grid, mode=mode, padding_mode=padding_mode, align_corners=align_corners)\n\n    # 6. Return the warped image\n    return warped_image\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import torch\n    from kornia.utils import create_meshgrid\n\n    grid = create_meshgrid(2, 2, False)  # 1x2x2x2\n    grid += 1  # apply offset in both directions\n    input = torch.ones(1, 1, 2, 2)\n    output = remap(input, grid[..., 0], grid[..., 1], align_corners=True)\n    print(output)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: We ensure that `map_x` and `map_y` have the same shape, as they represent the x and y coordinates for remapping.\n\n2. **Grid Creation**: We stack `map_x` and `map_y` to form a grid of shape `(B, H, W, 2)`, which is required by `grid_sample`.\n\n3. **Normalization**: If the coordinates are not normalized, we convert them to the range `[-1, 1]` to match the expected input for `grid_sample`.\n\n4. **Grid Sampling**: We use `F.grid_sample` to apply the transformation, which interpolates the input image based on the provided grid.\n\n5. **Return**: The function returns the warped image tensor, which has the same shape as the input image tensor.",
