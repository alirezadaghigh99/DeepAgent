This serves as the base for our transformation matrix.\n\n2. **Scaling Factors**: The diagonal elements of the matrix are adjusted to scale the pixel coordinates to the range [-1, 1]. The scaling factors are calculated as `2.0 / (dimension - 1)`, where `dimension` is the depth, height, or width. The `max` function with `eps` ensures we avoid division by zero.\n\n3. **Translation Components**: The translation components are set to -1.0 to center the coordinates in the range [-1, 1].\n\n4. **Reshape**: The matrix is reshaped to have a shape of (1, 4, 4) to match the expected output format.\n\n5. **Return**: The function returns the normalized transform matrix.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called normal_transform_pixel3d that computes the normalization matrix from image size in pixels to the range [-1, 1]. The function takes in the image depth, height, width, epsilon value (eps), device, and data type (dtype) as inputs. It returns a normalized transform matrix with a shape of (1, 4, 4). The function first creates a 4x4 tensor matrix and then adjusts the values based on the image dimensions to prevent divide-by-zero errors. Finally, it returns the normalized transform matrix with a shape of 1x4x4.",
