This ratio helps in correcting the bias introduced by off-policy actions.\n\n3. **Truncation**: If a `truncation_threshold` is provided, we clip the importance sampling ratio to prevent excessively large updates.\n\n4. **Corrected Advantage**: The advantage is scaled by the importance sampling ratio to correct for the off-policy bias.\n\n5. **Policy Gradient Loss**: The loss is computed as the negative mean of the product of the corrected advantage and the log probability of the action. This is a standard way to compute the policy gradient loss in reinforcement learning.\n\nThis function assumes that `action_distrib` and `action_distrib_mu` are PyTorch distribution objects that support the `log_prob` method, which is typical for distributions in PyTorch.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called compute_policy_gradient_loss that computes the policy gradient loss with off-policy bias correction. The function takes in the following inputs: action (the action taken), advantage (the advantage of taking that action), action_distrib (the distribution of actions), action_distrib_mu (the distribution of actions from the behavior policy), action_value (the value of the action taken), v (the value function), and truncation_threshold (optional threshold for truncating the off-policy policy gradient term). The function returns the policy gradient loss as a scalar value.",
