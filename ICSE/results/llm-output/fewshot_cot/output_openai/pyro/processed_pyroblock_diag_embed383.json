    "result": "To complete the `block_diag_embed` function, we need to construct a block diagonal matrix from a batch of matrices. The input tensor `mat` has a shape of `(..., B, M, N)`, where `B` is the batch size, and `M` and `N` are the dimensions of each matrix in the batch. The output should be a block diagonal matrix with shape `(..., B * M, B * N)`.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef block_diag_embed(mat):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a tensor of shape (..., B, M, N) and returns a block diagonal tensor\n    of shape (..., B x M, B x N).\n\n    :param torch.Tensor mat: an input tensor with 3 or more dimensions\n    :returns torch.Tensor: a block diagonal tensor with dimension `m.dim() - 1`\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Get the shape of the input tensor\n    *batch_dims, B, M, N = mat.shape\n\n    # 2. Create a zero tensor of the desired output shape\n    #    The shape is (..., B * M, B * N)\n    block_diag_shape = (*batch_dims, B * M, B * N)\n    block_diag = torch.zeros(block_diag_shape, dtype=mat.dtype, device=mat.device)\n\n    # 3. Use a loop to fill in the block diagonal elements\n    for i in range(B):\n        # Calculate the start and end indices for the current block\n        start_row = i * M\n        end_row = start_row + M\n        start_col = i * N\n        end_col = start_col + N\n\n        # 4. Assign the current matrix to the appropriate block\n        block_diag[..., start_row:end_row, start_col:end_col] = mat[..., i, :, :]\n\n    # 5. Return the block diagonal tensor\n    return block_diag\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Shape Extraction**: We extract the shape of the input tensor to get the batch dimensions and the dimensions of each matrix.\n\n2. **Zero Tensor Creation**: We create a zero tensor with the desired output shape, which is `(..., B * M, B * N)`.\n\n3. **Loop Over Batch**: We loop over each matrix in the batch. For each matrix, we calculate the appropriate indices in the block diagonal matrix where this matrix should be placed.\n\n4. **Block Assignment**: We assign each matrix to its corresponding block in the block diagonal matrix.\n\n5. **Return**: Finally, we return the constructed block diagonal tensor.",
