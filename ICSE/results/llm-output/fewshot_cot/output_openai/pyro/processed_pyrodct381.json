    "result": "To implement a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) of type II in PyTorch, scaled to be orthonormal, you can follow these steps. This implementation will be equivalent to `scipy.fftpack.dct` with `norm=\"ortho\"`. PyTorch does not have a built-in DCT function, so we will use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to compute it.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `dct` function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef dct(x: torch.Tensor, dim: int = -1) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) of type II, scaled to be orthonormal.\n\n    This is equivalent to `scipy.fftpack.dct` with `norm=\"ortho\"`.\n\n    :param x: The input signal.\n    :param dim: Dimension along which to compute DCT.\n    :return: The DCT-II of the input signal.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Get the size of the dimension along which to compute the DCT\n    N = x.size(dim)\n\n    # 2. Compute the FFT of the input signal along the specified dimension\n    X = torch.fft.fft(x, n=2*N, dim=dim)\n\n    # 3. Extract the real part of the FFT result, which corresponds to the DCT\n    #    We only need the first N elements\n    X_real = X.real.narrow(dim, 0, N)\n\n    # 4. Create a scaling factor for orthonormalization\n    factor = torch.cat([\n        torch.tensor([0.5], dtype=x.dtype, device=x.device),\n        torch.full((N-1,), 0.5, dtype=x.dtype, device=x.device)\n    ])\n\n    # 5. Apply the scaling factor\n    X_scaled = X_real * factor\n\n    # 6. Return the scaled DCT result\n    return X_scaled\n\n# Example usage:\n# x = torch.randn(10)\n# dct_result = dct(x)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **FFT Computation**: We compute the FFT of the input signal `x` along the specified dimension `dim`. We use `n=2*N` to ensure that the FFT is computed over a length that is twice the size of the input, which is a common trick to compute the DCT using FFT.\n\n2. **Extract Real Part**: The DCT is the real part of the FFT of a symmetrically extended signal. We extract the real part of the FFT result and take only the first `N` elements.\n\n3. **Scaling for Orthonormality**: We apply a scaling factor to ensure that the DCT is orthonormal. The first element is scaled by `0.5`, and the rest are scaled by `0.5` as well.\n\nThis implementation should give you the DCT-II of the input signal, scaled to be orthonormal, similar to `scipy.fftpack.dct` with `norm=\"ortho\"`.",
