    "result": "Certainly! Below is a step-by-step implementation of the `_create_pytorch_loss` method for the `L2Loss` class, which calculates the mean squared error (MSE) loss without reduction:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch.nn import Module\n\nclass Loss(Module):\n    # Assuming this is a base class for different loss functions\n    pass\n\nclass L2Loss(Loss):\n    def _create_pytorch_loss(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Create a PyTorch loss function to calculate the mean squared error (MSE) loss\n        without reduction. Ensures the shapes of `output` and `labels` are consistent.\n        \"\"\"\n        def mse_loss(output: torch.Tensor, labels: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n            # 1. Ensure the shapes of `output` and `labels` are consistent\n            if output.shape != labels.shape:\n                raise ValueError(f\"Shape mismatch: output shape {output.shape} and labels shape {labels.shape} must be the same.\")\n\n            # 2. Compute the squared differences between `output` and `labels`\n            squared_diff = (output - labels) ** 2\n\n            # 3. Return the mean squared error without reduction\n            return squared_diff\n\n        return mse_loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Shape Consistency Check**: The function first checks if the shapes of `output` and `labels` are the same. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Squared Differences Calculation**: It computes the squared differences between the `output` and `labels`.\n\n3. **Return MSE Without Reduction**: The function returns the squared differences, which represent the MSE loss without any reduction (i.e., not averaged or summed).\n\nThis implementation provides a basic structure for calculating the MSE loss without reduction, ensuring that the input tensors have consistent shapes.",
