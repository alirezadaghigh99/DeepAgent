    "result": "To create a Python function called `_create_pytorch_loss` that calculates the sigmoid cross entropy loss between output logits and labels using PyTorch, you can follow these steps. This function will be a method of a class, presumably inheriting from a base class like `Loss`. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nclass SigmoidCrossEntropy(Loss):\n    def _create_pytorch_loss(self, logits: torch.Tensor, labels: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the sigmoid cross entropy loss between logits and labels.\n\n        Args:\n            logits (torch.Tensor): The input logits with shape (batch_size) or (batch_size, tasks).\n            labels (torch.Tensor): The target labels with the same shape as logits.\n\n        Returns:\n            torch.Tensor: The calculated loss values.\n        \"\"\"\n        # 1. Ensure logits and labels have the same shape\n        if logits.shape != labels.shape:\n            raise ValueError(\"Logits and labels must have the same shape.\")\n\n        # 2. Apply the sigmoid function to the logits\n        sigmoid_logits = torch.sigmoid(logits)\n\n        # 3. Calculate the binary cross entropy loss\n        loss = F.binary_cross_entropy(sigmoid_logits, labels, reduction='none')\n\n        # 4. Return the loss tensor\n        return loss\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Steps:\n\n1. **Shape Check**: Ensure that the `logits` and `labels` tensors have the same shape. This is crucial because the loss calculation requires element-wise operations.\n\n2. **Sigmoid Activation**: Apply the sigmoid function to the logits to convert them into probabilities. This is necessary because the sigmoid cross entropy loss operates on probabilities.\n\n3. **Binary Cross Entropy Loss**: Use PyTorch's `binary_cross_entropy` function to compute the loss. The `reduction='none'` argument ensures that the loss is calculated for each element individually, returning a tensor of the same shape as the input.\n\n4. **Return the Loss**: Finally, return the computed loss tensor.\n\nThis function assumes that the `Loss` class is defined elsewhere and that it is appropriate to include this method within it. If `Loss` is a custom class, ensure it is properly defined and integrated with PyTorch's loss computation framework.",
