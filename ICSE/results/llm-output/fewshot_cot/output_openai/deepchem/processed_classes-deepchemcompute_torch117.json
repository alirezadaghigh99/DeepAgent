    "result": "To implement the `_compute_pytorch_loss` function for calculating the softmax cross-entropy loss using PyTorch, you can follow these steps. This function will handle both 2D and 3D input shapes for logits and labels, which correspond to single-task and multi-task scenarios, respectively.\n\nHere's a step-by-step implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nclass SoftmaxCrossEntropy:\n    def _compute_pytorch_loss(self, output, labels):\n        \"\"\"\n        Compute the softmax cross-entropy loss between output logits and labels.\n\n        Args:\n            output (Tensor): Logits tensor of shape (batch_size, classes) or (batch_size, tasks, classes).\n            labels (Tensor): Labels tensor of shape (batch_size, classes) or (batch_size, tasks, classes).\n\n        Returns:\n            Tensor: Loss values tensor.\n        \"\"\"\n        # 1. Check if the input is 2D or 3D to handle single-task or multi-task scenarios\n        if output.dim() == 2:\n            # Single-task: output and labels are of shape (batch_size, classes)\n            # 2. Compute the cross-entropy loss directly\n            loss = F.cross_entropy(output, labels)\n        elif output.dim() == 3:\n            # Multi-task: output and labels are of shape (batch_size, tasks, classes)\n            # 3. Reshape the output and labels to combine batch and tasks dimensions\n            batch_size, tasks, classes = output.shape\n            output = output.view(batch_size * tasks, classes)\n            labels = labels.view(batch_size * tasks, classes)\n            \n            # 4. Compute the cross-entropy loss for each task\n            loss = F.cross_entropy(output, labels)\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Output and labels must be 2D or 3D tensors.\")\n\n        # 5. Return the computed loss\n        return loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The function first checks the dimensionality of the `output` tensor to determine if it's dealing with a single-task (2D) or multi-task (3D) scenario.\n\n2. **Single-task Case**: If the input is 2D, it directly computes the cross-entropy loss using `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy`.\n\n3. **Multi-task Case**: If the input is 3D, it reshapes the `output` and `labels` tensors to combine the batch and task dimensions. This allows the use of `cross_entropy` in a similar manner as the single-task case.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: If the input tensors are neither 2D nor 3D, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n5. **Return**: The function returns the computed loss tensor.",
