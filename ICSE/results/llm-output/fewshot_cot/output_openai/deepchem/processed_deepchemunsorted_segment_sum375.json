    "result": "To create a function `unsorted_segment_sum` that computes the sum along segments of a tensor, similar to TensorFlow's `tf.unsorted_segment_sum`, we can follow a step-by-step approach. This function will take a tensor, segment IDs, and the number of segments as inputs and return a tensor where each segment contains the sum of the elements corresponding to that segment ID.\n\nHere's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef unsorted_segment_sum(data, segment_ids, num_segments):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the sum along segments of a tensor.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    data : torch.Tensor\n        The input tensor to be segmented.\n    segment_ids : torch.Tensor\n        A 1-D tensor with the same size as the first dimension of `data`.\n        Contains the segment IDs for each element in `data`.\n    num_segments : int\n        The number of distinct segment IDs.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    torch.Tensor\n        A tensor of shape (num_segments, ...) where each segment contains\n        the sum of the elements corresponding to that segment ID.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Initialize an output tensor with zeros, with shape (num_segments, ...) \n    #    where ... represents the remaining dimensions of `data`.\n    output_shape = (num_segments,) + data.shape[1:]\n    output = torch.zeros(output_shape, dtype=data.dtype, device=data.device)\n\n    # 2. Iterate over each element in `data` and its corresponding segment ID.\n    for i, segment_id in enumerate(segment_ids):\n        # 3. Add the data element to the corresponding segment in the output tensor.\n        output[segment_id] += data[i]\n\n    # 4. Return the output tensor containing the summed segments.\n    return output\n\n# Example usage:\ndata = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]])\nsegment_ids = torch.tensor([0, 1, 0, 1])\nnum_segments = 2\n\nresult = unsorted_segment_sum(data, segment_ids, num_segments)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by creating an output tensor filled with zeros. The shape of this tensor is determined by the number of segments and the shape of the input data, excluding the first dimension.\n\n2. **Iteration and Summation**: We iterate over each element in the input data and its corresponding segment ID. For each element, we add its value to the appropriate segment in the output tensor.\n\n3. **Return**: Finally, we return the output tensor, which contains the sum of elements for each segment.\n\nThis function assumes that `segment_ids` is a 1-D tensor with the same length as the first dimension of `data`, and `num_segments` is the total number of unique segment IDs. The function efficiently computes the sum for each segment without requiring the segment IDs to be sorted.",
