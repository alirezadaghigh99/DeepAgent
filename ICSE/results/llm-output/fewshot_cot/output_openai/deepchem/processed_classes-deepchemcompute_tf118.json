    "result": "To implement the `_compute_tf_loss` function for calculating the softmax cross-entropy loss using TensorFlow, you can follow these steps. This function will handle both 2D and 3D input shapes for logits and labels, which correspond to single-task and multi-task scenarios, respectively.\n\nHere's a step-by-step implementation:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.losses import Loss\n\nclass SoftmaxCrossEntropy(Loss):\n    def _compute_tf_loss(self, output, labels):\n        \"\"\"\n        Compute the softmax cross-entropy loss between logits and labels.\n\n        Args:\n            output (tf.Tensor): Logits tensor with shape (batch_size, classes) or (batch_size, tasks, classes).\n            labels (tf.Tensor): Labels tensor with the same shape as output.\n\n        Returns:\n            tf.Tensor: Loss values tensor.\n        \"\"\"\n        # 1. Check if the output and labels have the same shape\n        if output.shape != labels.shape:\n            raise ValueError(\"Output and labels must have the same shape.\")\n\n        # 2. Determine if the input is 2D or 3D\n        if len(output.shape) == 2:\n            # Single-task case: (batch_size, classes)\n            # 3. Compute the softmax cross-entropy loss for 2D inputs\n            loss = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=output)\n        elif len(output.shape) == 3:\n            # Multi-task case: (batch_size, tasks, classes)\n            # 4. Reshape the tensors to combine batch_size and tasks into a single dimension\n            batch_size, tasks, classes = output.shape\n            output_reshaped = tf.reshape(output, [-1, classes])\n            labels_reshaped = tf.reshape(labels, [-1, classes])\n\n            # 5. Compute the softmax cross-entropy loss for 3D inputs\n            loss = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels_reshaped, logits=output_reshaped)\n\n            # 6. Reshape the loss back to (batch_size, tasks)\n            loss = tf.reshape(loss, [batch_size, tasks])\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Output and labels must be 2D or 3D tensors.\")\n\n        # 7. Return the computed loss\n        return loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Shape Check**: Ensure that the `output` and `labels` tensors have the same shape to avoid mismatches during loss computation.\n\n2. **Dimensionality Handling**: Determine whether the input tensors are 2D or 3D. This helps in deciding how to compute the loss.\n\n3. **2D Case**: For single-task scenarios, directly compute the softmax cross-entropy loss using TensorFlow's `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits`.\n\n4. **3D Case**: For multi-task scenarios, reshape the tensors to treat each task as a separate instance, compute the loss, and then reshape the loss back to the original task structure.\n\n5. **Return Loss**: The function returns the computed loss tensor, which can be used for further processing or optimization.",
