This is important for numerical stability and consistency in calculations.\n\n2. **Shape Consistency Check**: It uses `tf.debugging.assert_shapes` to ensure that the shapes of `output` and `labels` are consistent. This prevents shape mismatches that could lead to runtime errors.\n\n3. **Squared Difference Calculation**: The squared difference between `output` and `labels` is computed using `tf.square`.\n\n4. **L2 Loss Calculation**: The mean of the squared differences is calculated using `tf.reduce_mean` to obtain the L2 loss.\n\n5. **Return the Loss**: Finally, the computed L2 loss is returned.",
