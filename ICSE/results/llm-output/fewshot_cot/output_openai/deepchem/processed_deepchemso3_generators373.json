The dimension of the representation is `dim = 2j + 1`, where `j = (k - 1) / 2`.\n\n2. **Matrix Initialization**: The generators \\( J_x \\), \\( J_y \\), and \\( J_z \\) are initialized as zero matrices of size `(dim, dim)`.\n\n3. **Matrix Filling**: The matrices are filled with the appropriate values using the known relationships for the SU(2) generators. These values are derived from the angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics.\n\n4. **Stacking**: The three generators are stacked into a single tensor for easy handling and return.\n\nThis function provides a way to generate the SO(3) generators for any given representation index `k`, which is useful in various applications involving 3D rotations.",
