    "result": "To complete the `forward` function for the `MultilayerPerceptron` class, we need to define how the input tensor `x` is processed through the network layers. This involves passing `x` through the sequential model defined in the `__init__` method and handling any skip connections if they are enabled. Here's how you can implement the `forward` method:\n\n```python\n    def forward(self, x: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # Pass the input through the model\n        out = self.model(x)\n        \n        # If skip connection is enabled, add the skip connection\n        if self.skip is not None:\n            skip_out = self.skip(x)\n            if self.weighted_skip:\n                # If weighted skip is enabled, combine the outputs\n                out = out + skip_out\n            else:\n                # If not weighted, just add the skip output\n                out = out + skip_out\n        \n        # Apply the activation function to the output\n        out = self.activation_fn(out)\n        \n        return out\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Model Forward Pass**: The input `x` is passed through the sequential model (`self.model`) which consists of the layers built in the `build_layers` method.\n\n2. **Skip Connection**: If `skip_connection` is enabled (`self.skip` is not `None`), the input `x` is also passed through the skip connection layer (`self.skip`). The result (`skip_out`) is then added to the output of the model. If `weighted_skip` is `True`, the skip connection is added directly to the output. If `weighted_skip` is `False`, the skip connection is still added, but you might want to handle it differently (e.g., scaling the skip connection).\n\n3. **Activation Function**: The activation function (`self.activation_fn`) is applied to the final output. This is typically done after the last layer in a neural network to introduce non-linearity.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the activation function should be applied after the skip connection is added. If the activation function should be applied before adding the skip connection, you would need to adjust the order of operations accordingly.",
