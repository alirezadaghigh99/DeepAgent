In this example, we use a threshold method where items with predictions above a certain threshold are considered relevant.\n\n3. **Group and Sort**: We group the data by user and sort the items by their prediction scores in descending order, selecting the top K items for each user.\n\n4. **Calculate Relevant Items**: We calculate the number of relevant items in the top K for each user.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Relevant Items**: We calculate the total number of relevant items in the true ratings for each user.\n\n6. **Calculate Recall per User**: We calculate the recall at K for each user by dividing the number of relevant items in the top K by the total number of relevant items.\n\n7. **Handle Edge Cases**: We handle cases where there are fewer than K items in the true ratings by ensuring the recall is capped at 1.\n\n8. **Calculate Mean Recall**: We calculate the mean recall across all users to get the final recall at K value.\n\nThis function provides a flexible way to calculate recall at K for a recommendation system, with the ability to specify different relevancy methods and thresholds.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called recall_at_k that calculates the recall at K for a recommendation system. The function takes in the following parameters: rating_true (a pandas DataFrame representing true ratings), rating_pred (a pandas DataFrame representing predicted ratings), col_user (a string representing the column name for user), col_item (a string representing the column name for item), col_prediction (a string representing the column name for prediction), relevancy_method (a string representing the method for determining relevancy), k (an integer representing the number of top K items per user), threshold (a float representing the threshold of top items per user).\n\nThe function returns a float value representing the recall at K (with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1). The maximum value is 1 even when fewer than K items exist for a user in rating_true. The function internally calls the merge_ranking_true_pred function to calculate the recall at K. If there are no hits in the data, the function returns 0.0.",
