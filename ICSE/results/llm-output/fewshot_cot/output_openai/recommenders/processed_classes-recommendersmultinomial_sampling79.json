    "result": "To implement the `multinomial_sampling` function for the `RBM` class, we will follow a step-by-step approach. The function will perform multinomial sampling using a rejection method on the input tensor `pr`, which represents the distribution of ratings. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nclass RBM:\n    def __init__(self, possible_ratings, visible_units, hidden_units=500, keep_prob=0.7, init_stdv=0.1, learning_rate=0.004, minibatch_size=100, training_epoch=20, display_epoch=10, sampling_protocol=[50, 70, 80, 90, 100], debug=False, with_metrics=False, seed=42):\n        pass\n\n    def multinomial_sampling(self, pr):\n        \"\"\"\n        Perform multinomial sampling of ratings using a rejection method.\n\n        Args:\n            pr (tf.Tensor): A tensor of shape (m, n, r) representing the distribution of ratings.\n\n        Returns:\n            tf.Tensor: A tensor of shape (m, n) with sampled ratings.\n        \"\"\"\n        # 1. Get the shape of the input tensor\n        m, n, r = pr.shape\n\n        # 2. Flatten the last dimension to prepare for sampling\n        pr_flat = tf.reshape(pr, [-1, r])\n\n        # 3. Sample from a multinomial distribution for each (m, n) pair\n        #    using the probabilities in the last dimension\n        sampled_indices = tf.random.categorical(tf.math.log(pr_flat), num_samples=1)\n\n        # 4. Reshape the sampled indices to match the (m, n) shape\n        sampled_ratings = tf.reshape(sampled_indices, [m, n])\n\n        # 5. Return the sampled ratings tensor\n        return sampled_ratings\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Get the Shape**: We first extract the shape of the input tensor `pr` to understand the dimensions we are working with.\n\n2. **Flatten the Last Dimension**: We reshape the tensor to combine the first two dimensions `(m, n)` into a single dimension, making it easier to perform sampling across the last dimension `(r)`.\n\n3. **Sample from Multinomial Distribution**: We use TensorFlow's `tf.random.categorical` function to perform multinomial sampling. This function takes the log probabilities and returns the indices of the sampled classes. The `num_samples=1` argument specifies that we want one sample per distribution.\n\n4. **Reshape the Sampled Indices**: After sampling, we reshape the result back to the original `(m, n)` shape to match the expected output format.\n\n5. **Return the Sampled Ratings**: Finally, we return the tensor containing the sampled ratings.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input tensor `pr` is a valid probability distribution over the last dimension, meaning that each slice `pr[i, j, :]` sums to 1.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `multinomial_sampling` for the class `RBM` that performs multinomial sampling of ratings using a rejection method. The function should take as input a tensor `pr` of shape `(m, n, r)`, representing the distribution of ratings, where `m` is the number of examples, `n` is the number of features, and `r` is the number of classes (ratings).  The function should return an `(m, n)` tf.tensor of sampled ratings, where each rating is determined by looking up the integer index of the maximum value in the sampled tensor.\n```python\nclass RBM:\n    def __init__(self, possible_ratings, visible_units, hidden_units=500, keep_prob=0.7, init_stdv=0.1, learning_rate=0.004, minibatch_size=100, training_epoch=20, display_epoch=10, sampling_protocol=[50, 70, 80, 90, 100], debug=False, with_metrics=False, seed=42):\n        pass\n\n    def multinomial_sampling(self, pr):\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
