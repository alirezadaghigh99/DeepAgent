    "result": "To implement the `sample_hidden_units` function for the `RBM` class, we need to calculate the activation probabilities of the hidden units and then sample the hidden units using these probabilities. The function will use TensorFlow for tensor operations and will rely on the `binomial_sampling` method to perform the sampling based on the calculated probabilities. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nclass RBM:\n    def __init__(self, possible_ratings, visible_units, hidden_units=500, keep_prob=0.7, init_stdv=0.1, learning_rate=0.004, minibatch_size=100, training_epoch=20, display_epoch=10, sampling_protocol=[50, 70, 80, 90, 100], debug=False, with_metrics=False, seed=42):\n        self.w = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([visible_units, hidden_units], stddev=init_stdv), name='weights')  # weights between visible and hidden units\n        self.bh = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([hidden_units]), name='hidden_bias')  # biases of the hidden units\n        self.keep = keep_prob  # dropout keep probability\n\n    def binomial_sampling(self, pr):\n        # Outputs a tensor of the same shape as pr, where each element is 1 if the corresponding\n        # probability is greater than a sampled uniform random value, and 0 otherwise.\n        random_tensor = tf.random.uniform(tf.shape(pr))\n        return tf.cast(pr > random_tensor, dtype=tf.float32)\n\n    def sample_hidden_units(self, vv):\n        \"\"\"\n        Sample hidden units based on the visible units.\n\n        Args:\n            vv (tf.Tensor): Tensor representing the visible units.\n\n        Returns:\n            phv (tf.Tensor): Activation probability of the hidden units.\n            h_ (tf.Tensor): Sampled hidden units.\n        \"\"\"\n        # 1. Compute the linear combination of inputs to the hidden units\n        linear_combination = tf.matmul(vv, self.w) + self.bh\n\n        # 2. Apply the sigmoid activation function to get the activation probabilities\n        phv = tf.nn.sigmoid(linear_combination)\n\n        # 3. Apply dropout regularization\n        phv_dropout = phv * self.keep\n\n        # 4. Sample the hidden units using the binomial sampling method\n        h_ = self.binomial_sampling(phv_dropout)\n\n        # 5. Return the activation probabilities and the sampled hidden units\n        return phv, h_\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Weights and Biases Initialization**: The weights (`self.w`) and biases (`self.bh`) are initialized in the constructor. The weights are initialized with a normal distribution, and the biases are initialized to zero.\n\n2. **Linear Combination**: The linear combination of the visible units and the weights, plus the biases, is computed to determine the input to the hidden units.\n\n3. **Activation Probabilities**: The sigmoid function is applied to the linear combination to compute the activation probabilities (`phv`) of the hidden units.\n\n4. **Dropout Regularization**: The activation probabilities are scaled by the dropout keep probability (`self.keep`) to apply dropout regularization.\n\n5. **Sampling**: The `binomial_sampling` method is used to sample the hidden units based on the dropout-scaled activation probabilities.\n\n6. **Return Values**: The function returns the activation probabilities and the sampled hidden units.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `sample_hidden_units` for the class `RBM` that samples hidden units based on the visible units (`vv`). This function should return two tensors: the activation probability of the hidden units (`phv`) and the sampled hidden units (`h_`). The sampling process involves using the weights (`self.w`), biases (`self.bh`), and dropout regularization (`self.keep`). The function relies on `binomial_sampling`, which outputs a tensor where each element is `1` if the corresponding activation probability exceeds a randomly sampled threshold, and `0` otherwise.You should use tf for this.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass RBM:\n    def __init__(self, possible_ratings, visible_units, hidden_units=500, keep_prob=0.7, init_stdv=0.1, learning_rate=0.004, minibatch_size=100, training_epoch=20, display_epoch=10, sampling_protocol=[50, 70, 80, 90, 100], debug=False, with_metrics=False, seed=42):\n        self.w = None  # weights between visible and hidden units\n        self.bh = None  # biases of the hidden units\n        self.keep = keep_prob  # dropout keep probability\n        pass\n\n    def binomial_sampling(self, pr):\n        # Outputs a tensor of the same shape as pr, where each element is 1 if the corresponding\n        # probability is greater than a sampled uniform random value, and 0 otherwise.\n        pass\n\n    def sample_hidden_units(self, vv):\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt",
