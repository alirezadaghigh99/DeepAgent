    "result": "To implement the `multinomial_distribution` function for the `RBM` class, we need to calculate the probability that a visible unit `v` has a specific value `l` given a linear combination `phi` of the values from the previous layer. This involves using the softmax function to convert the linear combination into probabilities. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nclass RBM:\n    def __init__(self, possible_ratings, visible_units, hidden_units=500, keep_prob=0.7, init_stdv=0.1, learning_rate=0.004, minibatch_size=100, training_epoch=20, display_epoch=10, sampling_protocol=[50, 70, 80, 90, 100], debug=False, with_metrics=False, seed=42):\n        self.possible_ratings = possible_ratings\n        pass\n\n    def multinomial_distribution(self, phi):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the probability that a visible unit v has a specific value l given a linear combination phi.\n\n        Args:\n            phi (tf.Tensor): A tensor representing the linear combination of inputs.\n\n        Returns:\n            tf.Tensor: A tensor of shape (m, Nv, r) representing the probabilities.\n        \"\"\"\n        # 1. Compute the exponential of phi to get unnormalized probabilities\n        exp_phi = tf.exp(phi)\n\n        # 2. Sum the exponentials along the last axis to normalize\n        sum_exp_phi = tf.reduce_sum(exp_phi, axis=-1, keepdims=True)\n\n        # 3. Divide exp_phi by the sum to get the normalized probabilities\n        probabilities = exp_phi / sum_exp_phi\n\n        # 4. Reshape the probabilities to (m, Nv, r) for faster sampling\n        reshaped_probabilities = tf.transpose(probabilities, perm=[1, 2, 0])\n\n        return reshaped_probabilities\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Exponential Calculation**: We first calculate the exponential of `phi` to get unnormalized probabilities. This is a common step in the softmax function.\n\n2. **Normalization**: We sum the exponentials along the last axis (which corresponds to the different possible ratings) to normalize the probabilities. This ensures that the sum of probabilities for each visible unit equals 1.\n\n3. **Probability Calculation**: We divide the unnormalized probabilities by the sum to get the normalized probabilities.\n\n4. **Reshape for Sampling**: Finally, we reshape the tensor to `(m, Nv, r)` using `tf.transpose` to allow for faster sampling when used in the multinomial function. Here, `m` is the number of samples, `Nv` is the number of visible units, and `r` is the number of possible ratings.\n\nThis function assumes that `phi` is a tensor of shape `(r, m, Nv)`, where `r` is the number of possible ratings, `m` is the number of samples, and `Nv` is the number of visible units. The output is reshaped to `(m, Nv, r)` to facilitate efficient sampling.",
