This ensures that the matrix and the prior probabilities are compatible.\n\n2. **Probability Matrix Check**: Verify that each row of the `noise_matrix` sums to 1, ensuring it represents a valid probability distribution.\n\n3. **Effective Class Probabilities**: Calculate the effective class probabilities after noise by multiplying the transpose of the `noise_matrix` with the prior probabilities `py`.\n\n4. **Learnability Check**: Use a heuristic to determine if the noise matrix allows for better than random performance. This is done by checking if the maximum effective probability is greater than the uniform probability (1/number of classes).\n\n5. **Return Result**: If all checks are passed, the function returns `True`, indicating the noise matrix is learnable. If any check fails, it returns `False`.\n\nThe `verbose` parameter allows for detailed output, which can be useful for debugging or understanding the process.",
