Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how you might implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_swap_box_scores(\n    labels: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]] = None,\n    predictions: Optional[List[np.ndarray]] = None,\n    alpha: float = 0.5,\n    high_probability_threshold: float = 0.9,\n    overlapping_label_check: bool = False,\n    auxiliary_inputs: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]] = None\n) -> List[np.ndarray]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate swap scores for annotated bounding boxes in images.\n\n    Args:\n        labels (List[Dict[str, Any]], optional): Annotations for each image.\n        predictions (List[np.ndarray], optional): Model predictions for each image.\n        alpha (float): Weighting parameter for score calculation.\n        high_probability_threshold (float): Threshold for high probability predictions.\n        overlapping_label_check (bool): Flag to check for overlapping labels.\n        auxiliary_inputs (List[Dict[str, Any]], optional): Additional inputs for each image.\n\n    Returns:\n        List[np.ndarray]: Swap scores for each annotated box in each image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

The score is adjusted using the `alpha` parameter.\n\n7. **Adjust for Overlapping Labels**: If `overlapping_label_check` is enabled, we adjust the score. This is a placeholder for the actual logic you might implement.\n\n8. **Store Scores**: We store the calculated score in the `img_scores` array.\n\n9. **Append Scores**: After processing all boxes in an image, we append the scores to the `swap_scores` list.\n\n10. **Return Scores**: Finally, we return the list of swap scores for all images.\n\nThis function provides a basic framework for calculating swap scores, and you can further refine the logic based on your specific requirements and data characteristics.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called compute_swap_box_scores that calculates a numeric score for each annotated bounding box in each image, estimating the likelihood that the class label for this box was not accidentally swapped with another class. The function takes in several optional parameters including labels (a list of dictionaries containing labels for each image), predictions (a list of numpy arrays corresponding to model predictions for each image), alpha (a weighting parameter), high_probability_threshold (a probability threshold), overlapping_label_check (a boolean flag), and auxiliary_inputs (a list of dictionaries containing additional inputs for each image).\n\nThe function returns a list of numpy arrays where each element corresponds to the swap scores for annotated boxes in each image. The scores range between 0 and 1, with lower values indicating boxes that are more likely to have been mislabeled. The function also handles cases where the number of annotated and predicted boxes vary for each image.",
