    "result": "To create the `_compute_label_quality_scores` function as described, we can follow a structured approach similar to the examples provided. Here's a step-by-step implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef _compute_label_quality_scores(\n    labels: list,\n    predictions: list,\n    method: str = \"objectlab\",\n    aggregation_weights: dict = None,\n    threshold: float = None,\n    overlapping_label_check: bool = True,\n    verbose: bool = True\n) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute label quality scores based on the specified method.\n\n    Args:\n        labels (list): A list of dictionaries containing any type of values.\n        predictions (list): A list of numpy arrays.\n        method (str): The method to use for computing scores. Default is \"objectlab\".\n        aggregation_weights (dict, optional): A dictionary with string keys and float values.\n        threshold (float, optional): A threshold value for pruning.\n        overlapping_label_check (bool): Whether to check for overlapping labels. Default is True.\n        verbose (bool): Whether to print verbose output. Default is True.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: An array of computed scores.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Validate the method parameter\n    if method != \"objectlab\":\n        raise ValueError(f\"Unsupported method: {method}. Only 'objectlab' is supported.\")\n\n    # 2. Initialize scores array\n    scores = np.zeros(len(labels))\n\n    # 3. Iterate over each label and corresponding prediction\n    for i, (label, prediction) in enumerate(zip(labels, predictions)):\n        if verbose:\n            print(f\"Processing label {i+1}/{len(labels)}\")\n\n        # 4. Prune extra bounding boxes based on threshold if provided\n        if threshold is not None:\n            prediction = prediction[prediction > threshold]\n\n        # 5. Check for overlapping labels if required\n        if overlapping_label_check:\n            # Implement logic to handle overlapping labels\n            # This is a placeholder for actual logic\n            if verbose:\n                print(\"Checking for overlapping labels...\")\n\n        # 6. Compute quality score for the current label\n        # Placeholder logic for score computation\n        score = np.sum(prediction)  # Example: sum of prediction values\n\n        # 7. Apply aggregation weights if provided\n        if aggregation_weights:\n            weight = aggregation_weights.get(label.get('type', ''), 1.0)\n            score *= weight\n\n        # 8. Store the computed score\n        scores[i] = score\n\n    # 9. Return the computed scores as a numpy array\n    return scores\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Method Validation**: The function first checks if the `method` is \"objectlab\". If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Scores Initialization**: An array of zeros is initialized to store the computed scores for each label.\n\n3. **Iteration**: The function iterates over each label and its corresponding prediction.\n\n4. **Pruning**: If a `threshold` is provided, predictions below this threshold are pruned.\n\n5. **Overlapping Check**: If `overlapping_label_check` is `True`, the function checks for overlapping labels. This is a placeholder for actual logic.\n\n6. **Score Computation**: The function computes a quality score for each label. Here, it's a simple sum of prediction values, but this can be replaced with more complex logic.\n\n7. **Aggregation Weights**: If `aggregation_weights` are provided, they are applied to the computed score.\n\n8. **Return**: The function returns the computed scores as a numpy array.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called _compute_label_quality_scores that takes in the following parameters:\n- labels: a list of dictionaries containing any type of values\n- predictions: a list of numpy arrays\n- method: an optional string parameter with a default value of \"objectlab\"\n- aggregation_weights: an optional dictionary with string keys and float values\n- threshold: an optional float parameter\n- overlapping_label_check: an optional boolean parameter with a default value of True\n- verbose: a boolean parameter with a default value of True\n\nThe function prunes extra bounding boxes and computes label quality scores based on the specified method.
