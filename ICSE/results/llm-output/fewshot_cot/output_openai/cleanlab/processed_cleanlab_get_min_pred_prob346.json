    "result": "To create the `_get_min_pred_prob` function as described, we can follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples provided. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef _get_min_pred_prob(predictions):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the minimum prediction probability from a list of NumPy arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        predictions (List[np.ndarray]): A list of NumPy arrays where each array\n                                        represents class predictions with probabilities.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The minimum prediction probability found in the input list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Initialize a list with a high value to ensure np.min has a non-empty array\n    pred_probs = [1.0]\n\n    # 2. Iterate over each prediction array in the input list\n    for prediction in predictions:\n        # 3. Extract the last column of each prediction array\n        last_column = prediction[:, -1]\n\n        # 4. Append the extracted probabilities to the pred_probs list\n        pred_probs.extend(last_column)\n\n    # 5. Calculate the minimum value in the pred_probs list\n    min_prob = np.min(pred_probs)\n\n    # 6. Return the minimum prediction probability\n    return min_prob\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `pred_probs` with a value of `1.0`. This ensures that `np.min` has a non-empty array to operate on, even if the input list is empty.\n\n2. **Iteration**: We loop through each prediction array in the `predictions` list.\n\n3. **Extraction**: For each prediction array, we extract the last column, which contains the class probabilities.\n\n4. **Appending**: We append these extracted probabilities to the `pred_probs` list.\n\n5. **Calculation**: We use `np.min` to find the minimum value in the `pred_probs` list.\n\n6. **Return**: Finally, we return the minimum prediction probability.\n\nThis function efficiently computes the minimum prediction probability from a list of prediction arrays, handling potential edge cases like empty input lists.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called _get_min_pred_prob that takes in a list of NumPy arrays called predictions. The function returns a float value which is the minimum prediction probability out of all the predictions in the input list. The function first initializes a list called pred_probs with a value of 1.0 to avoid calling np.min on an empty array. It then iterates through each prediction in the input list, extracts the last column of each class prediction, and appends it to the pred_probs list. Finally, the function calculates the minimum value in the pred_probs list using np.min and returns it as the output.",
