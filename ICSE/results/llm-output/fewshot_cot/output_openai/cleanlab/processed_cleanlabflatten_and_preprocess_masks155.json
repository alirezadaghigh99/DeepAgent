Return the flattened labels and the transposed, flattened pred_probs\n    return flattened_labels, transposed_flattened_pred_probs\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Flatten the `labels` array**: \n   - We use `labels.flatten()` to convert the 2D or 3D `labels` array into a 1D array. This is necessary to align it with the predicted probabilities.\n\n2. **Transpose the `pred_probs` array**:\n   - The `pred_probs` array is initially in the shape `(N, C, H, W)`, where `N` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the image.\n   - We transpose it to `(N, H, W, C)` using `np.transpose(pred_probs, (0, 2, 3, 1))` to bring the channels to the last dimension. This makes it easier to flatten the spatial dimensions while keeping the channel information intact.\n\n3. **Flatten the transposed `pred_probs` array**:\n   - We reshape the transposed array to `(-1, C)`, which flattens the spatial dimensions `(N, H, W)` into a single dimension while keeping the channels separate. This results in a 2D array where each row corresponds to a pixel and each column corresponds to a channel.\n\n4. **Return the processed arrays**:\n   - Finally, we return the `flattened_labels` and `transposed_flattened_pred_probs` arrays, which are now ready for further processing or analysis.",
