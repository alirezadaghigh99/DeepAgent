    "result": "To create the `get_label_quality_ensemble_scores` function, we can follow a structured approach similar to the examples provided. This function will compute label quality scores based on predictions from an ensemble of models.

Default is 'log_loss'.\n        adjust_pred_probs (bool): Whether to adjust the predicted probabilities. Default is False.\n        weight_ensemble_members_by (str): Weighting scheme to aggregate scores ('uniform', 'custom'). Default is 'uniform'.\n        custom_weights (np.ndarray): Custom weights if using the 'custom' weighting scheme. Default is None.\n        log_loss_search_T_values (list): List of float values for log loss search. Default is None.\n        verbose (bool): Whether to print statements. Default is False.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: Array containing one score per example, where lower scores indicate more likely mislabeled examples.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

The `adjust_probabilities` function is a placeholder for any specific adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Score Computation**: For each model, it computes label quality scores using the specified method. Here, only `log_loss` is implemented, but other methods can be added.\n\n5. **Score Aggregation**: It aggregates the scores from all models using the specified weights.\n\n6. **Return**: The function returns the aggregated scores, which indicate the likelihood of examples being mislabeled. Lower scores suggest higher likelihoods of mislabeling.",
