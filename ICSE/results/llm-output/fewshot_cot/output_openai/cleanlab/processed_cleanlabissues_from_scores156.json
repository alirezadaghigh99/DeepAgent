    "result": "To create the `issues_from_scores` function, we will follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples provided. This function will identify mislabeled pixels or images based on label quality scores and a user-defined threshold. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import Optional\n\ndef issues_from_scores(\n    image_scores: np.ndarray,\n    pixel_scores: Optional[np.ndarray] = None,\n    threshold: float = None\n) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Identify mislabeled pixels or images based on label quality scores and a user-defined threshold.\n\n    Args:\n        image_scores (np.ndarray): Array of shape (N,) for image scores.\n        pixel_scores (Optional[np.ndarray]): Optional array of shape (N, H, W) for pixel-level scores.\n        threshold (float): A value between 0 and 1 that determines which scores are considered issues.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: A boolean mask if pixel_scores is provided, marking issues as True.\n                    An array of image indices if pixel_scores is not provided, for images below the threshold.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If image_scores is None, if threshold is outside the [0, 1] range, or if threshold is None.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Validate the input arguments\n    if image_scores is None:\n        raise ValueError(\"image_scores cannot be None.\")\n    if threshold is None or not (0 <= threshold <= 1):\n        raise ValueError(\"threshold must be a float between 0 and 1.\")\n\n    # 2. Determine if pixel_scores is provided\n    if pixel_scores is not None:\n        # 3. Check that pixel_scores has the correct shape\n        if pixel_scores.shape[0] != image_scores.shape[0]:\n            raise ValueError(\"The first dimension of pixel_scores must match the length of image_scores.\")\n\n        # 4. Create a boolean mask for pixel-level issues\n        pixel_issues_mask = pixel_scores < threshold\n        return pixel_issues_mask\n\n    else:\n        # 5. Identify image indices where the image score is below the threshold\n        image_issues_indices = np.where(image_scores < threshold)[0]\n        return image_issues_indices\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: \n   - We first check if `image_scores` is `None` and raise a `ValueError` if it is.\n   - We also validate the `threshold` to ensure it is within the range [0, 1] and not `None`.\n\n2. **Handling `pixel_scores`**:\n   - If `pixel_scores` is provided, we ensure its first dimension matches the length of `image_scores`.\n   - We then create a boolean mask where each pixel's score is compared against the `threshold`. Pixels with scores below the threshold are marked as `True`.\n\n3. **Handling Image Scores**:\n   - If `pixel_scores` is not provided, we identify the indices of images whose scores are below the threshold using `np.where`.\n\nThis function provides flexibility by handling both image-level and pixel-level scores, raising appropriate errors for invalid inputs, and returning the expected outputs based on the presence of `pixel_scores`.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `issues_from_scores` that identifies mislabeled pixels or images based on label quality scores and a user-defined `threshold`.
