    "result": "To create a function that computes the Kronecker product between two PyTorch tensors, you can follow these steps. The Kronecker product is a mathematical operation that takes two matrices (or tensors) and produces a block matrix. Here's how you can implement it in Python using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef kron(t1: torch.Tensor, t2: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the Kronecker product of two tensors.\n\n    Args:\n        t1 (torch.Tensor): The first input tensor.\n        t2 (torch.Tensor): The second input tensor.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: The Kronecker product of t1 and t2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Get the shapes of the input tensors\n    t1_shape = t1.shape\n    t2_shape = t2.shape\n\n    # 2. Compute the shape of the resulting Kronecker product\n    kron_shape = (t1_shape[0] * t2_shape[0], t1_shape[1] * t2_shape[1])\n\n    # 3. Use the outer product to compute the Kronecker product\n    #    Reshape t1 and t2 to enable broadcasting\n    t1_expanded = t1.unsqueeze(2).unsqueeze(3)\n    t2_expanded = t2.unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(1)\n\n    # 4. Compute the Kronecker product using broadcasting\n    kron_product = (t1_expanded * t2_expanded).reshape(kron_shape)\n\n    # 5. Return the resulting Kronecker product tensor\n    return kron_product\n\n# Example usage:\nt1 = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\nt2 = torch.tensor([[0, 5], [6, 7]])\nkron_product = kron(t1, t2)\nprint(kron_product)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Shapes**: The function first retrieves the shapes of the input tensors `t1` and `t2`.\n\n2. **Resulting Shape**: The shape of the Kronecker product is calculated as the product of the dimensions of `t1` and `t2`.\n\n3. **Reshape for Broadcasting**: The tensors are reshaped to allow for element-wise multiplication using broadcasting. This involves adding extra dimensions to `t1` and `t2`.\n\n4. **Compute Kronecker Product**: The Kronecker product is computed by performing an element-wise multiplication of the expanded tensors and then reshaping the result to the desired shape.\n\n5. **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns the computed Kronecker product.\n\nThis implementation efficiently computes the Kronecker product using PyTorch's broadcasting capabilities.",
