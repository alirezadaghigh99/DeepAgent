    "result": "To create the `forgetting` function as described, we can follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples provided. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef forgetting(accuracy_matrix, boundary_indices=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate forgetting based on an accuracy matrix and boundary indices.\n\n    Args:\n        accuracy_matrix (np.ndarray): A 2D array with shape (time, experiences) representing accuracy over time.\n        boundary_indices (List[int], optional): Indices indicating the start of each experience. \n                                                Defaults to a range from 0 to the number of experiences.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: A forgetting matrix with the same shape as the input accuracy matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Determine the number of experiences from the accuracy matrix shape\n    num_experiences = accuracy_matrix.shape[1]\n\n    # 2. If boundary_indices is not provided, create a default range\n    if boundary_indices is None:\n        boundary_indices = list(range(num_experiences))\n\n    # 3. Initialize the forgetting matrix with zeros, same shape as accuracy_matrix\n    forgetting_matrix = np.zeros_like(accuracy_matrix)\n\n    # 4. Loop over each experience to calculate forgetting\n    for exp_idx in range(num_experiences):\n        # 5. Determine the time index when the experience was learned\n        learn_time = boundary_indices[exp_idx]\n\n        # 6. Calculate forgetting for each time step after the experience was learned\n        for time_idx in range(learn_time, accuracy_matrix.shape[0]):\n            # 7. Subtract the accuracy at learn_time from the current accuracy\n            forgetting_matrix[time_idx, exp_idx] = accuracy_matrix[learn_time, exp_idx] - accuracy_matrix[time_idx, exp_idx]\n\n    # 8. Return the forgetting matrix\n    return forgetting_matrix\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Experiences**: We first determine the number of experiences from the shape of the `accuracy_matrix`.\n\n2. **Default Boundary Indices**: If `boundary_indices` is not provided, we assume it to be a list ranging from 0 to the number of experiences.\n\n3. **Initialize Forgetting Matrix**: We create a matrix of zeros with the same shape as the `accuracy_matrix` to store the forgetting values.\n\n4. **Loop Over Experiences**: For each experience, we calculate the forgetting by iterating over the time steps starting from when the experience was learned.\n\n5. **Calculate Forgetting**: For each time step after the experience was learned, we subtract the accuracy at the time the experience was learned from the current accuracy.\n\n6. **Return the Forgetting Matrix**: Finally, we return the forgetting matrix, which contains the calculated forgetting values for each experience over time.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called forgetting that calculates forgetting based on an accuracy matrix and boundary indices. The function takes in a 2D accuracy matrix with shape <time, experiences> and an optional list of boundary indices. If boundary_indices is not provided, it is assumed to be a list ranging from 0 to the number of experiences in the accuracy matrix. \n\nThe forgetting calculation is done by subtracting the accuracy at the time the experience was learned from the current accuracy for each experience. Forgetting is set to zero before learning on the experience. The function returns a forgetting matrix with the same shape as the input accuracy matrix.",
