    "result": "To create a Python function called `_create_identity_grid` that generates a grid of normalized coordinates for a given image size, you can follow these steps. The function will take a list of integers representing the dimensions of the grid (height and width) and return a PyTorch Tensor containing the grid coordinates. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _create_identity_grid(size):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a grid of normalized coordinates for a given image size.\n\n    Args:\n        size (List[int]): A list containing the dimensions of the grid (height, width).\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: A tensor containing the grid coordinates, normalized to [-1, 1].\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Extract height and width from the size list\n    height, width = size\n\n    # 2. Create a range of values for the x and y coordinates\n    #    These values are normalized to [-1, 1]\n    x = torch.linspace(-1, 1, steps=width)\n    y = torch.linspace(-1, 1, steps=height)\n\n    # 3. Use meshgrid to create a grid of x and y coordinates\n    #    The grid will have shape (height, width, 2)\n    grid_y, grid_x = torch.meshgrid(y, x, indexing='ij')\n\n    # 4. Stack the x and y grids to create a grid of coordinates\n    #    The resulting tensor will have shape (height, width, 2)\n    grid = torch.stack((grid_x, grid_y), dim=-1)\n\n    # 5. Return the grid tensor\n    return grid\n\n# Example usage:\nsize = [5, 5]\ngrid = _create_identity_grid(size)\nprint(grid)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Extract Dimensions**: The function starts by extracting the height and width from the input list `size`.\n\n2. **Create Normalized Ranges**: It uses `torch.linspace` to create ranges of x and y coordinates, normalized to the range [-1, 1]. This normalization is typical for spatial transformations in deep learning.\n\n3. **Create Meshgrid**: The `torch.meshgrid` function is used to create a grid of x and y coordinates. The `indexing='ij'` argument ensures that the first dimension corresponds to y (height) and the second to x (width).\n\n4. **Stack Coordinates**: The x and y grids are stacked along the last dimension to create a grid of coordinates. Each element in the grid contains a pair of x and y coordinates.\n\n5. **Return the Grid**: Finally, the function returns the grid tensor, which can be used for spatial transformations.",
