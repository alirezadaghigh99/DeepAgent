    "result": "To create the `pil_to_tensor` function as described, we can follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples provided. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport numpy as np\nfrom PIL import Image\n\ndef pil_to_tensor(pic):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert a PIL Image to a tensor of the same type.\n\n    Args:\n        pic (PIL.Image): The input image to be converted.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor: A tensor representation of the image.\n\n    Raises:\n        TypeError: If the input is not a PIL Image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Check if the input is a PIL Image\n    if not isinstance(pic, Image.Image):\n        raise TypeError(f\"Input should be a PIL Image. Got {type(pic)}\")\n\n    # 2. Handle accimage case (if applicable)\n    # Assuming accimage is not used here, as it's not a standard library.\n    # If accimage is used, you would handle it here.\n\n    # 3. Convert the PIL Image to a NumPy array\n    np_array = np.array(pic, copy=True)\n\n    # 4. Convert the NumPy array to a PyTorch tensor\n    #    If the image is grayscale, add a channel dimension\n    if np_array.ndim == 2:\n        np_array = np_array[:, :, None]\n\n    # 5. Rearrange dimensions from HWC to CHW\n    tensor = torch.from_numpy(np_array).permute(2, 0, 1)\n\n    # 6. Return the tensor\n    return tensor\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Type Check**: The function first checks if the input is a PIL Image. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n\n2. **Accimage Handling**: The function description mentions handling `accimage`, but since `accimage` is not a standard library, this step is noted but not implemented. If you have `accimage` support, you would handle it here.\n\n3. **Conversion to NumPy Array**: The PIL Image is converted to a NumPy array. The `copy=True` ensures a deep copy of the data.\n\n4. **Grayscale Handling**: If the image is grayscale (2D array), a channel dimension is added to make it compatible with PyTorch's CHW format.\n\n5. **Dimension Rearrangement**: The dimensions of the array are rearranged from HWC (Height, Width, Channels) to CHW (Channels, Height, Width) to match PyTorch's expected input format.\n\n6. **Return Tensor**: Finally, the function returns the tensor representation of the image.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called pil_to_tensor that converts a PIL Image to a tensor of the same type. The input parameter is a PIL Image called pic. The function does not support torchscript. It performs a deep copy of the underlying array. If the input is not a PIL Image, a TypeError is raised. If the input is an accimage Image, the function returns a tensor of type uint8. Otherwise, it converts the PIL Image to a tensor, rearranges the dimensions, and returns the tensor.",
