    "result": "To create the `_get_perspective_coeffs` function, we need to calculate the coefficients for a perspective transformation using the provided `startpoints` and `endpoints`. The transformation maps each point `(x, y)` in the original image to a new point `(x', y')` in the transformed image using the following equations:\n\n\\[ x' = \\frac{ax + by + c}{gx + hy + 1} \\]\n\\[ y' = \\frac{dx + ey + f}{gx + hy + 1} \\]\n\nWe need to solve for the coefficients `(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h)` using the given points. Here's how you can implement this function using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _get_perspective_coeffs(startpoints, endpoints):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the coefficients for a perspective transformation.\n\n    Args:\n        startpoints (list of tuple): List of four (x, y) tuples representing the corners of the original image.\n        endpoints (list of tuple): List of four (x, y) tuples representing the corners of the transformed image.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: A tensor containing the eight perspective transformation coefficients.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(startpoints) != 4 or len(endpoints) != 4:\n        raise ValueError(\"Both startpoints and endpoints must contain exactly four points.\")\n\n    # Convert points to double precision tensors\n    startpoints = torch.tensor(startpoints, dtype=torch.float64)\n    endpoints = torch.tensor(endpoints, dtype=torch.float64)\n\n    # Prepare the matrix A and vector B for the linear system Ax = B\n    A = []\n    B = []\n\n    for (x, y), (x_prime, y_prime) in zip(startpoints, endpoints):\n        A.append([x, y, 1, 0, 0, 0, -x_prime * x, -x_prime * y])\n        A.append([0, 0, 0, x, y, 1, -y_prime * x, -y_prime * y])\n        B.append(x_prime)\n        B.append(y_prime)\n\n    A = torch.tensor(A, dtype=torch.float64)\n    B = torch.tensor(B, dtype=torch.float64)\n\n    # Solve the linear system using least squares\n    coeffs, _ = torch.lstsq(B, A)\n\n    # The result from lstsq includes extra rows, we only need the first 8 coefficients\n    coeffs = coeffs[:8].squeeze()\n\n    # Convert the coefficients to single precision before returning\n    return coeffs.to(dtype=torch.float32)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if both `startpoints` and `endpoints` contain exactly four points. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Data Preparation**: The points are converted to double precision tensors to ensure numerical stability during calculations.\n\n3. **Matrix Setup**: The matrix `A` and vector `B` are constructed to represent the linear system of equations derived from the perspective transformation equations.\n\n4. **Solving the System**: The `torch.lstsq` function is used to solve the linear system `Ax = B` for the coefficients. The result includes extra rows, so we only take the first 8 coefficients.\n\n5. **Precision Conversion**: The coefficients are converted to single precision before being returned.\n\nThis function uses PyTorch for matrix operations, ensuring efficient computation and compatibility with other PyTorch-based workflows.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function named `_get_perspective_coeffs` that calculates the eight coefficients required for performing a perspective transformation on an image. The function takes two lists of four coordinate pairs each, `startpoints` and `endpoints`, corresponding to the corners of the original and transformed images, respectively. It computes the coefficients `(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h)` using least squares to map each pixel `(x, y)` in the original image to its new position in the transformed image. The function should validate that exactly four corners are provided for both inputs, raising a `ValueError` if this condition is not met. Calculations should be performed in double precision to ensure numerical stability, with results converted to single precision before returning. Use the PyTorch library for matrix operations and numerical computations.",
