    "result": "To create a Python function called `sigmoid_focal_loss` that calculates the focal loss used in RetinaNet for dense detection, we can follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples provided. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef sigmoid_focal_loss(inputs, targets, alpha=0.25, gamma=2.0, reduction='none'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the sigmoid focal loss between `inputs` and `targets`.\n\n    Args:\n        inputs (Tensor): Predictions for each example.\n        targets (Tensor): Binary classification labels for each example.\n        alpha (float): Weighting factor for positive examples.\n        gamma (float): Exponent factor to balance easy vs hard examples.\n        reduction (str): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:\n                         'none' | 'mean' | 'sum'. 'none': no reduction will be applied,\n                         'mean': the sum of the output will be divided by the number of\n                         elements in the output, 'sum': the output will be summed.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor: Loss tensor with the specified reduction applied.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Apply the sigmoid function to the inputs to get probabilities\n    prob = torch.sigmoid(inputs)\n\n    # 2. Compute the binary cross-entropy loss\n    bce_loss = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(inputs, targets, reduction='none')\n\n    # 3. Compute the modulating factor (1 - p_t)^gamma\n    p_t = prob * targets + (1 - prob) * (1 - targets)\n    modulating_factor = (1 - p_t) ** gamma\n\n    # 4. Compute the alpha factor\n    alpha_factor = alpha * targets + (1 - alpha) * (1 - targets)\n\n    # 5. Compute the focal loss\n    focal_loss = alpha_factor * modulating_factor * bce_loss\n\n    # 6. Apply the specified reduction\n    if reduction == 'mean':\n        return focal_loss.mean()\n    elif reduction == 'sum':\n        return focal_loss.sum()\n    else:  # 'none'\n        return focal_loss\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Sigmoid Activation**: The function first applies the sigmoid function to the `inputs` to convert them into probabilities.\n\n2. **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss**: It calculates the binary cross-entropy loss using `F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits`, which is more numerically stable than applying sigmoid followed by binary cross-entropy.\n\n3. **Modulating Factor**: The modulating factor `(1 - p_t)^gamma` is computed to down-weight easy examples and focus more on hard examples.\n\n4. **Alpha Factor**: The alpha factor is used to balance the importance of positive and negative examples.\n\n5. **Focal Loss Calculation**: The focal loss is computed by multiplying the binary cross-entropy loss with the modulating and alpha factors.\n\n6. **Reduction**: The function supports three types of reduction: 'none', 'mean', and 'sum'. The appropriate reduction is applied to the computed focal loss before returning it.\n\nThis implementation should provide a flexible and efficient way to compute the focal loss for dense detection tasks.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called sigmoid_focal_loss that calculates the focal loss used in RetinaNet for dense detection. The function takes in four parameters: inputs (a float tensor of arbitrary shape representing predictions), targets (a float tensor with the same shape as inputs representing binary classification labels), alpha (a float weighting factor to balance positive vs negative examples), gamma (a float exponent to balance easy vs hard examples), and reduction (a string specifying the reduction option for the output). The function returns a loss tensor with the specified reduction option applied. The function implements the focal loss formula and handles different reduction options such as 'none', 'mean', or 'sum'.",
