    "result": "To complete the `resnet_fpn_backbone` function, we need to follow a series of steps to construct a ResNet backbone with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) on top. This involves setting up the ResNet model, freezing the appropriate layers, and integrating the FPN.

By default, we return layers 1 through 4.\n\n3. **IntermediateLayerGetter**: This utility helps in extracting intermediate layers from the model, which is necessary for constructing the FPN.\n\n4. **Freeze Layers**: We freeze the specified number of layers to prevent them from being updated during training. This is done by setting `requires_grad` to `False`.\n\n5. **Create the FPN**: We construct the FPN using the `BackboneWithFPN` class, specifying the layers to return, the input and output channels, and any extra blocks (like `LastLevelMaxPool`).\n\nThis function provides a flexible way to create a ResNet backbone with an FPN, suitable for use in object detection models like Faster R-CNN.",
