    "result": "To create a Python function called `box_area` that computes the area of a set of bounding boxes, we can follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples provided. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef box_area(boxes: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the area of a set of bounding boxes.\n\n    Args:\n        boxes (Tensor): A tensor of shape (N, 4) where N is the number of boxes.\n                        Each box is represented by (x1, y1, x2, y2) coordinates.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor: A tensor of shape (N) containing the area of each box.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Ensure the input tensor has the correct shape\n    if boxes.ndim != 2 or boxes.shape[1] != 4:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input boxes should have shape (N, 4)\")\n\n    # 2. Extract the coordinates of the boxes\n    x1, y1, x2, y2 = boxes.unbind(dim=1)\n\n    # 3. Compute the width and height of each box\n    widths = x2 - x1\n    heights = y2 - y1\n\n    # 4. Compute the area of each box\n    areas = widths * heights\n\n    # 5. Return the areas as a tensor\n    return areas\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: We first check if the input tensor `boxes` has the correct shape `(N, 4)`. If not, we raise a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Extract Coordinates**: We use `torch.unbind` to split the tensor into four separate tensors, each representing one of the coordinates: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.\n\n3. **Compute Width and Height**: The width of each box is calculated as `x2 - x1`, and the height is calculated as `y2 - y1`.\n\n4. **Compute Area**: The area of each box is simply the product of its width and height.\n\n5. **Return Areas**: Finally, we return the computed areas as a tensor. This tensor has shape `(N)`, where each element corresponds to the area of a box.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called box_area that computes the area of a set of bounding boxes specified by their (x1, y1, x2, y2) coordinates. The input is a tensor of shape (N, 4) called boxes, where N is the number of boxes. The boxes are expected to be in (x1, y1, x2, y2) format with 0 <= x1 < x2 and 0 <= y1 < y2.
