    "result": "To implement the `normalize` method for the `GeneralizedRCNNTransform` class, you need to perform normalization on the input image by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. The mean and standard deviation are provided during the class initialization. Here's how you can implement this method:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import nn, Tensor\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Optional, Dict, Any\n\nclass GeneralizedRCNNTransform(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, min_size: int, max_size: int, image_mean: List[float], image_std: List[float], size_divisible: int = 32, fixed_size: Optional[Tuple[int, int]] = None, **kwargs: Any):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.min_size = min_size\n        self.max_size = max_size\n        self.image_mean = image_mean\n        self.image_std = image_std\n        self.size_divisible = size_divisible\n        self.fixed_size = fixed_size\n        self._skip_resize = kwargs.pop(\"_skip_resize\", False)\n\n    def normalize(self, image: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # Check if the image is of floating point type\n        if not image.is_floating_point():\n            raise TypeError(\n                f\"Expected input images to be of floating type (in range [0, 1]), \"\n                f\"but found type {image.dtype} instead\"\n            )\n\n        # Convert mean and std to tensors for broadcasting\n        mean = torch.tensor(self.image_mean, device=image.device).view(-1, 1, 1)\n        std = torch.tensor(self.image_std, device=image.device).view(-1, 1, 1)\n\n        # Normalize the image\n        image = (image - mean) / std\n\n        return image\n\n    def resize(self, image: Tensor, target: Optional[Dict[str, Tensor]] = None) -> Tuple[Tensor, Optional[Dict[str, Tensor]]]:\n        # Resize the input image and target (if provided) based on the specified size constraints\n        pass\n\n    def batch_images(self, images: List[Tensor], size_divisible: int = 32) -> Tensor:\n        # Batch the list of images into a single tensor, ensuring that all images have the same dimensions\n        pass\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Floating Point Check**: The method first checks if the input image is of a floating-point type. This is important because normalization typically assumes that the image pixel values are in the range [0, 1].\n\n2. **Mean and Std Conversion**: The mean and standard deviation lists are converted to tensors and reshaped to allow broadcasting across the image dimensions. This ensures that the mean and standard deviation are applied to each channel of the image.\n\n3. **Normalization**: The image is normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each channel.\n\n4. **Return**: The method returns the normalized image tensor.",
