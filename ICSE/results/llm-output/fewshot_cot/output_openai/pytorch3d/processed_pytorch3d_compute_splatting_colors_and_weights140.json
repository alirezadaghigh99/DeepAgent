    "result": "To create the `_compute_splatting_colors_and_weights` function, we need to calculate the splatting weights and colors for each center pixel and its surrounding splatting pixels. The function will use the provided pixel coordinates, colors, and offsets to compute these values.

Calculate the Gaussian kernel factor based on sigma\n    gaussian_factor = 1 / (2 * sigma ** 2)\n\n    # 2. Initialize the output tensor for splatting colors and weights\n    N, H, W, K, _ = pixel_coords_screen.shape\n    splat_colors_and_weights = torch.zeros((N, H, W, K, 9, 5), dtype=colors.dtype, device=colors.device)\n\n    # 3. Iterate over each of the 9 splatting directions\n    for i, offset in enumerate(offsets):\n        # 4. Compute the offset pixel coordinates for each splatting direction\n        offset_coords = pixel_coords_screen + offset\n\n        # 5. Calculate the squared distance between the original and offset coordinates\n        squared_distances = torch.sum((pixel_coords_screen - offset_coords) ** 2, dim=-1)\n\n        # 6. Compute the splatting weights using the Gaussian kernel\n        splatting_weights = torch.exp(-squared_distances * gaussian_factor)\n\n        # 7. Assign the colors and weights to the output tensor\n        splat_colors_and_weights[..., i, :4] = colors\n        splat_colors_and_weights[..., i, 4] = splatting_weights\n\n    # 8. Return the tensor containing splatting colors and weights\n    return splat_colors_and_weights\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Gaussian Kernel Factor**: We calculate a factor for the Gaussian kernel using the provided `sigma`. This factor is used to compute the splatting weights.\n\n2. **Output Tensor Initialization**: We initialize a tensor `splat_colors_and_weights` to store the results. Its shape is `(N, H, W, K, 9, 5)`, where the last dimension holds the RGBA colors and the weight.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Splatting Directions**: We loop over each of the 9 splatting directions provided in `offsets`.\n\n4. **Offset Coordinates**: For each direction, we compute the offset pixel coordinates by adding the offset to the original coordinates.\n\n5. **Squared Distances**: We calculate the squared distance between the original and offset coordinates, which is used to determine the weight.\n\n6. **Splatting Weights**: We compute the splatting weights using a Gaussian function based on the squared distances.\n\n7. **Assign Colors and Weights**: We assign the original colors and the computed weights to the appropriate positions in the output tensor.\n\n8. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the tensor containing the splatting colors and weights.",
