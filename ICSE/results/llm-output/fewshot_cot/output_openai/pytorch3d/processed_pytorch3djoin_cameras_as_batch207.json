If any camera has a different set of attributes, we raise an error.\n\n6. **Batching Attributes**: We concatenate each tensor attribute across the batch dimension. We also check that each attribute is a tensor and compatible for concatenation.\n\n7. **Create Batched Camera**: We create a new camera object of the same type as the input cameras, using the concatenated attributes.\n\n8. **Return**: Finally, we return the batched camera object.",
