If weights are provided, they should match the first two dimensions of `X` and `Y`.\n\n2. **Weights Normalization**: Normalize the weights to sum to 1 for each batch.\n\n3. **Centroid Calculation**: Compute the weighted centroids of `X` and `Y`.\n\n4. **Centering Points**: Subtract the centroids from the points to center them.\n\n5. **Covariance Matrix**: Compute the covariance matrix between the centered points.\n\n6. **SVD**: Perform Singular Value Decomposition on the covariance matrix.\n\n7. **Rotation Matrix**: Compute the rotation matrix `R` using the results from SVD.\n\n8. **Reflection Handling**: Adjust `R` to prevent reflection if `allow_reflection` is `False`.\n\n9. **Scale Calculation**: Compute the scale `s` if `estimate_scale` is `True`.\n\n10. **Translation Calculation**: Compute the translation vector `T`.\n\n11. **Return**: Return the computed rotation, translation, and scale as a named tuple `SimilarityTransform`.",
