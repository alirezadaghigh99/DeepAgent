    "result": "To create the `camera_position_from_spherical_angles` function, we will follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples provided. This function will calculate the camera's position in 3D space based on spherical coordinates, which are defined by a distance from the target point, and elevation and azimuth angles. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom typing import Union\n\ndef camera_position_from_spherical_angles(\n    distance: float,\n    elevation: float,\n    azimuth: float,\n    degrees: bool = True,\n    device: Union[str, torch.device] = \"cpu\"\n) -> Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the camera position in 3D space from spherical angles.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): Distance from the target point.\n        elevation (float): Elevation angle from the horizontal plane.\n        azimuth (float): Azimuth angle from the reference direction.\n        degrees (bool): If True, angles are in degrees. If False, in radians.\n        device (Union[str, torch.device]): The device on which to perform calculations.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor: A tensor of shape (N, 3) representing the xyz location of the camera.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Convert angles from degrees to radians if necessary\n    if degrees:\n        elevation = torch.tensor(elevation, device=device) * (torch.pi / 180.0)\n        azimuth = torch.tensor(azimuth, device=device) * (torch.pi / 180.0)\n    else:\n        elevation = torch.tensor(elevation, device=device)\n        azimuth = torch.tensor(azimuth, device=device)\n\n    # 2. Ensure distance is a tensor and broadcast to shape (N, 1)\n    distance = torch.tensor(distance, device=device).reshape(-1, 1)\n\n    # 3. Calculate the Cartesian coordinates from spherical coordinates\n    x = distance * torch.cos(elevation) * torch.cos(azimuth)\n    y = distance * torch.cos(elevation) * torch.sin(azimuth)\n    z = distance * torch.sin(elevation)\n\n    # 4. Concatenate the coordinates to form the (N, 3) output tensor\n    camera_position = torch.cat((x, y, z), dim=-1)\n\n    # 5. Return the resulting tensor\n    return camera_position\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Angle Conversion**: If the angles are provided in degrees, they are converted to radians using the formula \\(\\text{radians} = \\text{degrees} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180}\\).\n\n2. **Distance Broadcasting**: The `distance` is converted to a tensor and reshaped to ensure it has the shape \\((N, 1)\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of samples.\n\n3. **Cartesian Coordinates Calculation**: Using the spherical to Cartesian conversion formulas:\n   - \\(x = \\text{distance} \\times \\cos(\\text{elevation}) \\times \\cos(\\text{azimuth})\\)\n   - \\(y = \\text{distance} \\times \\cos(\\text{elevation}) \\times \\sin(\\text{azimuth})\\)\n   - \\(z = \\text{distance} \\times \\sin(\\text{elevation})\\)\n\n4. **Concatenation**: The calculated \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) coordinates are concatenated along the last dimension to form the final output tensor of shape \\((N, 3)\\).\n\n5. **Return**: The function returns the tensor representing the camera's position in 3D space.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called camera_position_from_spherical_angles that calculates the location of the camera based on the distance away from the target point, the elevation and azimuth angles. The function takes in parameters distance (float), elevation (float), azimuth (float), degrees (bool = True), and device (Device = \"cpu\") and returns a torch.Tensor representing the (N, 3) xyz location of the camera. The angles can be specified in either degrees or radians, and the function handles broadcasting the input arguments to have shape (N, 1) before performing the calculations.",
