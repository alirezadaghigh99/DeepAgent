    "result": "To create the `_se3_V_matrix` function, we need to compute the \"V\" matrix used in SE(3) transformations. This matrix is typically used in the context of Lie algebra and Lie group transformations, particularly for rigid body transformations in 3D space. The \"V\" matrix is derived from the exponential map of the SE(3) Lie algebra.\n\nHere's a step-by-step implementation of the `_se3_V_matrix` function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _se3_V_matrix(\n    log_rotation: torch.Tensor,\n    log_rotation_hat: torch.Tensor,\n    log_rotation_hat_square: torch.Tensor,\n    rotation_angles: torch.Tensor,\n    eps: float = 1e-4\n) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the \"V\" matrix used in SE(3) transformations.\n\n    Args:\n        log_rotation (torch.Tensor): The logarithm of the rotation matrix.\n        log_rotation_hat (torch.Tensor): The skew-symmetric matrix derived from `log_rotation`.\n        log_rotation_hat_square (torch.Tensor): The square of the skew-symmetric matrix.\n        rotation_angles (torch.Tensor): The angles of rotation.\n        eps (float, optional): A small value for numerical stability. Defaults to 1e-4.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: The computed \"V\" matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Compute the sine and cosine of the rotation angles\n    sin_angle = torch.sin(rotation_angles)\n    cos_angle = torch.cos(rotation_angles)\n\n    # 2. Compute the angle squared and handle small angles for numerical stability\n    angle_squared = rotation_angles ** 2\n    angle_squared = torch.where(angle_squared < eps, eps, angle_squared)\n\n    # 3. Compute the coefficients for the V matrix\n    A = sin_angle / rotation_angles\n    B = (1 - cos_angle) / angle_squared\n    C = (1 - A) / angle_squared\n\n    # 4. Compute the V matrix using the coefficients and the skew-symmetric matrices\n    V = torch.eye(3) + B.unsqueeze(-1).unsqueeze(-1) * log_rotation_hat + C.unsqueeze(-1).unsqueeze(-1) * log_rotation_hat_square\n\n    return V\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Trigonometric Functions**: We compute the sine and cosine of the rotation angles, which are essential for constructing the \"V\" matrix.\n\n2. **Numerical Stability**: We handle small angles by ensuring that the angle squared is not too close to zero, which could cause numerical instability. We use `torch.where` to replace very small values with `eps`.\n\n3. **Coefficients Calculation**: The coefficients \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) are derived from the Taylor series expansion of the matrix exponential. These coefficients are used to construct the \"V\" matrix.\n\n4. **Matrix Construction**: The \"V\" matrix is constructed using the identity matrix and the skew-symmetric matrices, scaled by the coefficients.\n\nThis function assumes that the input tensors are compatible in terms of dimensions and that the operations are performed in a batch-wise manner if needed. Adjustments might be necessary depending on the specific use case and input dimensions.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `_se3_V_matrix` that computes the \"V\" matrix used in SE(3) transformations.
