    "result": "To implement the `masked_gather` function, we need to follow a series of steps to ensure that we correctly gather points from the `points` tensor based on the indices provided in `idx`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Validate Input Dimensions**: Ensure that the batch dimensions of `points` and `idx` match. If they don't, raise a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Replace `-1` Indices**: Replace any `-1` indices in `idx` with `0` to avoid errors during the gathering process.\n\n3. **Gather Points**: Use the modified `idx` to gather points from the `points` tensor.\n\n4. **Mask Gathered Points**: Set the gathered points corresponding to the original `-1` indices to `0.0`.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: Return the modified tensor with the gathered points.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `masked_gather` function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef masked_gather(points: torch.Tensor, idx: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Gather points from a tensor based on indices, handling padding indices.\n\n    Args:\n        points (torch.Tensor): The tensor containing points to gather from.\n        idx (torch.Tensor): The indices to gather, with `-1` indicating padding.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: The gathered points tensor.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Validate that the batch dimensions of points and idx match\n    if points.size(0) != idx.size(0):\n        raise ValueError(\"Batch dimensions of points and idx must match.\")\n\n    # 2. Replace `-1` indices in idx with `0`\n    idx_replaced = idx.clone()\n    idx_replaced[idx_replaced == -1] = 0\n\n    # 3. Gather points using the modified indices\n    gathered_points = torch.gather(points, 1, idx_replaced.unsqueeze(-1).expand(-1, -1, points.size(-1)))\n\n    # 4. Set gathered points corresponding to original `-1` indices to `0.0`\n    mask = (idx == -1).unsqueeze(-1).expand_as(gathered_points)\n    gathered_points[mask] = 0.0\n\n    # 5. Return the gathered points tensor\n    return gathered_points\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Input Validation**: We first check if the batch dimensions of `points` and `idx` match. If not, a `ValueError` is raised.\n\n- **Index Replacement**: We create a copy of `idx` and replace all `-1` values with `0`. This ensures that we don't attempt to gather from an invalid index.\n\n- **Gathering**: We use `torch.gather` to collect points from `points` based on the modified indices. The `unsqueeze` and `expand` operations ensure that the dimensions match for gathering.\n\n- **Masking**: We create a mask to identify where the original `-1` indices were and set the corresponding gathered points to `0.0`.\n\n- **Return**: Finally, we return the tensor with the gathered points, with padding indices set to zero.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function `masked_gather` that collects points from a tensor `points` based on indices provided in `idx`, where some indices might be `-1` to indicate padding. The function should replace `-1` indices with `0`, gather the corresponding points, and then set the gathered values corresponding to the original `-1` indices to `0.0`. Ensure that `points` and `idx` have matching batch dimensions, and raise a `ValueError` if they do not. The function should handle different shapes of `idx` and return the gathered points tensor.",
