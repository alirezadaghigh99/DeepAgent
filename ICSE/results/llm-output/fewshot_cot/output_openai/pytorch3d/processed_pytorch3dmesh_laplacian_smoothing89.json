If so, we return a tensor with zero value.\n\n2. **Prepare Mesh Data**: We extract the packed vertices, packed faces, the number of vertices per mesh, and the vertex-to-mesh index from the `meshes` object.\n\n3. **Calculate Weights**: We compute the weights for each vertex based on the number of vertices in its corresponding mesh. This is done by taking the inverse of the number of vertices per mesh and gathering it according to the vertex-to-mesh index.\n\n4. **Compute the Laplacian**: Depending on the specified method, we compute the Laplacian matrix:\n   - **Uniform**: Use the uniform Laplacian.\n   - **Cotangent and Cotangent Curvature**: Use cotangent weights, optionally adjusted by the inverse of the area for cotangent curvature.\n\n5. **Calculate the Loss**: We compute the Laplacian loss by transforming vertices into normals using the Laplacian matrix and then computing the norm of the loss.\n\n6. **Weight the Loss**: We multiply the loss by the computed weights and average it across the batch.\n\n7. **Return the Loss**: Finally, we return the averaged loss as the output.\n\n### Error Handling:\n- We raise a `ValueError` if the method is not one of \"uniform\", \"cot\", or \"cotcurv\".",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function mesh_laplacian_smoothing that computes the Laplacian smoothing objective for a batch of 3D meshes. The function supports three variants of Laplacian smoothing: \"uniform,\" \"cotangent\" (cot), and \"cotangent curvature\" (cotcurv).
