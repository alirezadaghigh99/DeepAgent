    "result": "To implement the `transform_points` method for the `Transform3d` class, we need to handle both 2D and 3D input formats for the points, apply a homogeneous transformation using the transformation matrix, and ensure numerical stability by clamping the homogeneous coordinate if an `eps` value is provided. Here's a step-by-step implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: str = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self._matrix = matrix if matrix is not None else torch.eye(4, dtype=dtype, device=device)\n        self._transforms = []\n        self.device = device\n        self.dtype = dtype\n\n    def transform_points(self, points: torch.Tensor, eps: Optional[float] = None) -> torch.Tensor:\n        \"\"\"\n        Transforms a set of 3D points using the transformation matrix.\n\n        Args:\n            points (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape (P, 3) or (N, P, 3).\n            eps (Optional[float]): Small value to clamp the homogeneous coordinate.\n\n        Returns:\n            torch.Tensor: Transformed points of the same shape as input.\n        \"\"\"\n        # 1. Check the shape of the input points\n        if points.dim() == 2:\n            # (P, 3) -> (1, P, 3) for consistent processing\n            points = points.unsqueeze(0)\n        elif points.dim() != 3 or points.size(-1) != 3:\n            raise ValueError(\"Input points should have shape (P, 3) or (N, P, 3).\")\n\n        # 2. Add a homogeneous coordinate (1) to the points\n        ones = torch.ones(*points.shape[:-1], 1, dtype=points.dtype, device=points.device)\n        points_homogeneous = torch.cat([points, ones], dim=-1)  # Shape: (N, P, 4)\n\n        # 3. Apply the transformation matrix using batched matrix multiplication\n        transformed_homogeneous = torch.bmm(points_homogeneous, self._matrix.transpose(0, 1))\n\n        # 4. Extract the homogeneous coordinate\n        w = transformed_homogeneous[..., -1:]\n\n        # 5. Clamp the homogeneous coordinate if eps is provided\n        if eps is not None:\n            w = torch.clamp(w, min=eps)\n\n        # 6. Divide by the homogeneous coordinate to get the final transformed points\n        transformed_points = transformed_homogeneous[..., :-1] / w\n\n        # 7. Return the transformed points, ensuring the same shape as input\n        return transformed_points.squeeze(0) if points.dim() == 2 else transformed_points\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The method first checks the shape of the input points. If the points are in 2D format `(P, 3)`, they are unsqueezed to `(1, P, 3)` for consistent processing. This allows us to handle both 2D and 3D inputs uniformly.\n\n2. **Homogeneous Coordinates**: A column of ones is added to the points to convert them into homogeneous coordinates `(N, P, 4)`.\n\n3. **Transformation**: The transformation matrix is applied using batched matrix multiplication (`torch.bmm`). The matrix is transposed to align with the points' dimensions.\n\n4. **Clamping**: If an `eps` value is provided, the homogeneous coordinate is clamped to avoid division by zero.\n\n5. **Normalization**: The transformed points are normalized by dividing by the homogeneous coordinate.\n\n6. **Output**: The method returns the transformed points, ensuring the output shape matches the input shape.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `transform_points` for the `Transform3d` class that transforms a set of 3D points using the transformation matrix. The method should handle points in either 2D (P, 3) or 3D (N, P, 3) format, where P is the number of points and N is the batch size. It should perform a homogeneous transformation, adding a fourth coordinate to the points, applying the transformation matrix using batched matrix multiplication, and then dividing by the homogeneous coordinate. If an optional `eps` argument is provided, it should clamp the homogeneous coordinate to avoid division by zero.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: Device = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self._matrix = ...\n        self._transforms = []\n        self.device = ...\n        self.dtype = ...\n\n    def transform_points(self, points, eps: Optional[float] = None) -> torch.Tensor:\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
