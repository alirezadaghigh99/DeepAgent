    "result": "To implement the `inverse` method for the `Transform3d` class, we need to consider two scenarios based on the `invert_composed` argument. Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing this method:\n\n1. **Initialize the Method**: Define the `inverse` method with the `invert_composed` parameter, defaulting to `False`.\n\n2. **Handle the `invert_composed` Case**:\n   - If `invert_composed` is `True`, first compose all stored transformations into a single transformation matrix.\n   - Invert this composed matrix to get the inverse transformation.\n   - Create a new `Transform3d` object with this inverted matrix.\n\n3. **Handle the Non-`invert_composed` Case**:\n   - If `invert_composed` is `False`, invert each stored transformation individually.\n   - Reverse the order of these inverted transformations to maintain the correct transformation sequence.\n   - Create a new `Transform3d` object with these inverted transformations.\n\n4. **Return the New `Transform3d` Object**: Ensure the new object is initialized with the correct device and dtype.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: str = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self._matrix = matrix if matrix is not None else torch.eye(4, dtype=dtype, device=device)\n        self._transforms = []\n        self.device = device\n        self.dtype = dtype\n\n    def inverse(self, invert_composed: bool = False) -> \"Transform3d\":\n        if invert_composed:\n            # Compose all transformations into a single matrix\n            composed_matrix = self._matrix.clone()\n            for transform in self._transforms:\n                composed_matrix = transform @ composed_matrix\n            \n            # Invert the composed matrix\n            inverse_matrix = torch.linalg.inv(composed_matrix)\n            \n            # Return a new Transform3d object with the inverted matrix\n            return Transform3d(dtype=self.dtype, device=self.device, matrix=inverse_matrix)\n        else:\n            # Invert each transformation individually and reverse the order\n            inverted_transforms = [torch.linalg.inv(transform) for transform in reversed(self._transforms)]\n            \n            # Create a new Transform3d object\n            new_transform = Transform3d(dtype=self.dtype, device=self.device)\n            new_transform._transforms = inverted_transforms\n            \n            return new_transform\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Matrix Inversion**: We use `torch.linalg.inv` to invert matrices, which is efficient and handles the inversion of 4x4 matrices typically used in 3D transformations.\n- **Order of Transformations**: When not composing, the order of transformations is reversed after inversion to maintain the correct sequence.\n- **Device and Dtype**: The new `Transform3d` object is initialized with the same device and dtype as the original to ensure compatibility.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `inverse` for the `Transform3d` class that returns a new `Transform3d` object representing the inverse of the current transformation. The method should have an argument `invert_composed` which, when set to `True`, first composes the list of stored transformations and then inverts the result, and when set to `False`, inverts the individual stored transformations independently without composing them. The method should efficiently handle both cases, returning a new `Transform3d` object containing the inverse of the original transformation.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: Device = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self._matrix = ...\n        self._transforms = []\n        self.device = ...\n        self.dtype = ...\n\n    def inverse(self, invert_composed: bool = False) -> \"Transform3d\":\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
