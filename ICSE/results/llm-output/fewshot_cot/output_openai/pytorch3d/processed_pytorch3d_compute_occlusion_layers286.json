    "result": "To create the `_compute_occlusion_layers` function, we need to follow a structured approach similar to the examples provided. The function will analyze the depth information of each pixel and determine the occlusion status for each of the nine possible splatting directions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how you might implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _compute_occlusion_layers(q_depth: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute occlusion layers for each splatting pixel based on depth information.\n\n    Args:\n        q_depth (Tensor): A tensor of shape (N, H, W) representing the depth of each pixel.\n\n    Returns:\n        occlusion_layers (Tensor): A tensor of shape (N, H, W, 9) indicating occlusion status\n                                   for each of the nine splatting directions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Determine the shape of the input tensor\n    N, H, W = q_depth.shape\n\n    # 2. Initialize the occlusion_layers tensor with zeros\n    occlusion_layers = torch.zeros((N, H, W, 9), dtype=torch.int8)\n\n    # 3. Define the relative positions for the 9 splatting directions\n    directions = [\n        (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1),\n        (0, -1), (0, 0), (0, 1),\n        (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)\n    ]\n\n    # 4. Iterate over each direction to compute occlusion status\n    for idx, (dy, dx) in enumerate(directions):\n        # 5. Compute the shifted depth tensor for the current direction\n        shifted_depth = torch.roll(q_depth, shifts=(dy, dx), dims=(1, 2))\n\n        # 6. Determine occlusion status by comparing depths\n        #    -1: background (occluded by another splat above it)\n        #     0: same surface level\n        #     1: foreground\n        occlusion_status = torch.zeros_like(q_depth, dtype=torch.int8)\n        occlusion_status[q_depth < shifted_depth] = -1  # background\n        occlusion_status[q_depth == shifted_depth] = 0  # same surface\n        occlusion_status[q_depth > shifted_depth] = 1   # foreground\n\n        # 7. Assign the computed occlusion status to the corresponding layer\n        occlusion_layers[..., idx] = occlusion_status\n\n    # 8. Return the occlusion_layers tensor\n    return occlusion_layers\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Shape**: The function takes a tensor `q_depth` of shape `(N, H, W)`, where `N` is the batch size, `H` is the height, and `W` is the width of the depth map.\n\n2. **Output Shape**: The output tensor `occlusion_layers` has shape `(N, H, W, 9)`, where the last dimension corresponds to the nine splatting directions.\n\n3. **Directions**: The nine directions are defined relative to each pixel, including the pixel itself (center).\n\n4. **Occlusion Status**: For each direction, the function computes whether the splat is in the background, on the same surface, or in the foreground by comparing the depth values.\n\n5. **Rolling**: The `torch.roll` function is used to shift the depth tensor in each direction, allowing for comparison with the original depth tensor.\n\n6. **Occlusion Assignment**: The computed occlusion status for each direction is stored in the corresponding slice of the `occlusion_layers` tensor.\n\nThis function provides a detailed and efficient way to compute occlusion layers based on depth information, which can be useful in various computer vision and graphics applications.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called `_compute_occlusion_layers` that takes a tensor `q_depth` as input. The function calculates occlusion layers for each splatting pixel, determining whether it splats from a background, surface, or foreground depth relative to the splatted pixel. The output is a tensor `occlusion_layers` with shape (N, H, W, 9), where each of the 9 values corresponds to one of the nine splatting directions. The values in the tensor indicate whether the splat is on the same surface level as the pixel, in the background (occluded by another splat above it), or in the foreground.",
