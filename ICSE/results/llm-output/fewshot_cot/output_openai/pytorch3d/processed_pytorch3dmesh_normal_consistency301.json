    "result": "To define a function `mesh_normal_consistency` that computes the normal consistency of each mesh in a batch of meshes, we need to follow a structured approach. The function will take a `Meshes` object as input and return the average normal consistency across the batch. Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom pytorch3d.structures import Meshes\n\ndef mesh_normal_consistency(meshes: Meshes) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the normal consistency of each mesh in a batch of meshes.\n\n    Args:\n        meshes (Meshes): A batch of meshes.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average normal consistency across the batch.\n               Returns 0 if there are no meshes or all meshes are empty.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Check if the input contains any meshes\n    if len(meshes) == 0:\n        return 0.0\n\n    # 2. Initialize a list to store normal consistency for each mesh\n    normal_consistencies = []\n\n    # 3. Iterate over each mesh in the batch\n    for mesh in meshes:\n        # 4. Get the faces and vertices of the mesh\n        faces = mesh.faces_packed()\n        verts = mesh.verts_packed()\n\n        # 5. Check if the mesh is empty\n        if faces.numel() == 0 or verts.numel() == 0:\n            continue\n\n        # 6. Compute face normals\n        face_normals = mesh.faces_normals_packed()\n\n        # 7. Initialize a variable to accumulate the normal consistency for the current mesh\n        total_consistency = 0.0\n        num_edges = 0\n\n        # 8. Create a dictionary to map edges to their adjacent faces\n        edge_to_faces = {}\n\n        # 9. Iterate over each face to populate the edge_to_faces dictionary\n        for i, face in enumerate(faces):\n            for j in range(3):\n                edge = tuple(sorted((face[j].item(), face[(j + 1) % 3].item())))\n                if edge not in edge_to_faces:\n                    edge_to_faces[edge] = []\n                edge_to_faces[edge].append(i)\n\n        # 10. Calculate normal consistency for each edge\n        for edge, adjacent_faces in edge_to_faces.items():\n            if len(adjacent_faces) < 2:\n                continue  # Skip edges that do not have two adjacent faces\n\n            # 11. Compute the angle between the normals of the adjacent faces\n            normal1 = face_normals[adjacent_faces[0]]\n            normal2 = face_normals[adjacent_faces[1]]\n            cos_angle = torch.dot(normal1, normal2) / (normal1.norm() * normal2.norm())\n            angle = torch.acos(cos_angle.clamp(-1.0, 1.0))\n\n            # 12. Accumulate the angle to the total consistency\n            total_consistency += angle\n            num_edges += 1\n\n        # 13. Compute the average normal consistency for the current mesh\n        if num_edges > 0:\n            normal_consistency = total_consistency / num_edges\n            normal_consistencies.append(normal_consistency)\n\n    # 14. Compute the average normal consistency across all meshes\n    if len(normal_consistencies) == 0:\n        return 0.0\n\n    average_normal_consistency = sum(normal_consistencies) / len(normal_consistencies)\n    return average_normal_consistency\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Check**: The function first checks if there are any meshes in the input. If not, it returns 0.0.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Meshes**: For each mesh, it retrieves the faces and vertices. If a mesh is empty, it skips further processing.\n\n3. **Face Normals**: It computes the normals for each face using the `faces_normals_packed()` method.\n\n4. **Edge Mapping**: It creates a dictionary to map edges to their adjacent faces, which helps in finding neighboring faces sharing an edge.\n\n5. **Normal Consistency Calculation**: For each edge with two adjacent faces, it calculates the angle between their normals and accumulates this angle.\n\n6. **Average Consistency**: It computes the average normal consistency for each mesh and then across all meshes in the batch.\n\nThis function efficiently handles the computation of normal consistency for a batch of meshes, considering cases where multiple faces share an edge.",
    "prompt": "Define a Python function called mesh_normal_consistency that computes the normal consistency of each mesh in a batch of meshes. The function takes a Meshes object as input and returns the average normal consistency across the batch. If the input meshes contain no meshes or all empty meshes, the function returns 0. The normal consistency is calculated based on the angles between the normals of neighboring faces in the meshes. The function handles cases where multiple faces share an edge and efficiently finds the vertices associated with each edge.",
