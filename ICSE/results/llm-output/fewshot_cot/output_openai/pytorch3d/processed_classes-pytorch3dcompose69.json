    "result": "To implement the `compose` method for the `Transform3d` class, we need to ensure that the method combines the transformation matrices of the current instance with those of the provided `Transform3d` objects. The method should also update the internal list of transformations and verify that all provided arguments are instances of `Transform3d`. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: str = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self._matrix = matrix if matrix is not None else torch.eye(4, dtype=dtype, device=device)\n        self._transforms = [self._matrix]\n        self.device = device\n        self.dtype = dtype\n\n    def compose(self, *others: \"Transform3d\") -> \"Transform3d\":\n        # 1. Verify that all provided arguments are instances of Transform3d\n        for other in others:\n            if not isinstance(other, Transform3d):\n                raise TypeError(\"All arguments must be instances of Transform3d\")\n\n        # 2. Initialize the composed matrix with the current instance's matrix\n        composed_matrix = self._matrix.clone()\n\n        # 3. Iterate over each Transform3d object and multiply their matrices\n        for other in others:\n            composed_matrix = composed_matrix @ other._matrix\n\n        # 4. Create a new Transform3d instance with the composed matrix\n        new_transform = Transform3d(dtype=self.dtype, device=self.device, matrix=composed_matrix)\n\n        # 5. Update the internal list of transformations\n        new_transform._transforms = self._transforms + [other._matrix for other in others]\n\n        # 6. Return the new Transform3d instance\n        return new_transform\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The constructor initializes the transformation matrix to an identity matrix if none is provided. It also initializes the list of transformations with the current matrix.\n\n2. **Type Checking**: The `compose` method first checks that all arguments are instances of `Transform3d`. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n\n3. **Matrix Composition**: The method starts with the current instance's matrix and iteratively multiplies it with the matrices of the provided `Transform3d` objects. This is done using matrix multiplication (`@` operator).\n\n4. **New Instance Creation**: A new `Transform3d` instance is created with the composed matrix. This ensures that the original instance remains unchanged.\n\n5. **Updating Transformations List**: The new instance's `_transforms` list is updated to include the matrices of all the transformations involved in the composition.\n\n6. **Return**: Finally, the method returns the new `Transform3d` instance representing the composed transformation.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `compose` for the `Transform3d` class that combines the current transform with any number of other `Transform3d` objects passed as arguments. The method should return a new `Transform3d` instance representing the composed transformation, which combines the internal transformation matrix of the current instance with those of the provided transforms. Ensure that the internal list of transformations (`self._transforms`) is updated accordingly. The method should also verify that all provided arguments are instances of `Transform3d`.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: Device = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self._matrix = ...\n        self._transforms = []\n        self.device = ...\n        self.dtype = ...\n\n    def compose(self, *others: \"Transform3d\") -> \"Transform3d\":\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
