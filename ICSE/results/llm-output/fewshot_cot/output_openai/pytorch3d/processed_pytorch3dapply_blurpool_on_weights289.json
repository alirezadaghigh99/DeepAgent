    "result": "To create the `apply_blurpool_on_weights` function, we will follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples provided. This function will apply a 2-tap max filter followed by a 2-tap blur filter on the input tensor `weights`. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef apply_blurpool_on_weights(weights: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Apply a 2-tap max filter followed by a 2-tap blur filter on the input weights tensor.\n    \n    Args:\n        weights (torch.Tensor): Input tensor of shape (..., dim).\n        \n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: Blurred weights tensor of the same shape as the input.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Ensure the input is a floating-point tensor for precise operations\n    if not weights.is_floating_point():\n        weights = weights.to(torch.float32)\n\n    # 2. Pad the weights tensor to handle edge cases during pooling\n    #    We use 'reflect' padding to avoid boundary effects\n    padded_weights = F.pad(weights, (1, 1), mode='reflect')\n\n    # 3. Apply a 2-tap max filter using max pooling with kernel size 2\n    max_pooled_weights = F.max_pool1d(padded_weights.unsqueeze(0), kernel_size=2, stride=1).squeeze(0)\n\n    # 4. Apply a 2-tap blur filter using average pooling with kernel size 2\n    blurred_weights = F.avg_pool1d(max_pooled_weights.unsqueeze(0), kernel_size=2, stride=1).squeeze(0)\n\n    # 5. Return the blurred weights tensor, ensuring it has the same shape as the input\n    return blurred_weights\n\n# Example usage:\n# weights = torch.tensor([...], dtype=torch.float32)\n# blurred_weights = apply_blurpool_on_weights(weights)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Floating-point Conversion**: We ensure the input tensor is in a floating-point format to maintain precision during operations.\n\n2. **Padding**: We pad the input tensor using 'reflect' mode to handle edge cases and avoid boundary effects during pooling.\n\n3. **Max Pooling**: We apply a 2-tap max filter using `max_pool1d` with a kernel size of 2 and stride of 1 to create a wide upper envelope.\n\n4. **Blur Filter**: We apply a 2-tap blur filter using `avg_pool1d` with a kernel size of 2 and stride of 1 to smooth the envelope.\n\n5. **Output**: The resulting tensor, `blurred_weights`, retains the same shape as the input tensor `weights`.\n\nThis function effectively combines max pooling and average pooling to achieve the desired filtering effect on the weights tensor.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called apply_blurpool_on_weights that filters weights with a 2-tap max filter followed by a 2-tap blur filter, producing a wide and smooth upper envelope on the weights. The input is a tensor called weights of shape `(..., dim)` and the output is a tensor called blured_weights of the same shape `(..., dim)`. The function pads the weights, applies max pooling, and then performs linear interpolation to create the blurred weights.",
