    "result": "To create the `expand_image_array_cnn` function, we can follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples provided. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef expand_image_array_cnn(image_arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Ensure the input image array is in the correct format for CNNs.\n    \n    If the input is a 2D grayscale image, convert it to a 3D array by repeating\n    the grayscale values across three channels. If the input is already a 3D array,\n    validate its dimensions.\n\n    Parameters:\n    image_arr (np.ndarray): A NumPy array representing the input image. The array\n                            can be 2D (grayscale) or 3D (RGB).\n\n    Returns:\n    np.ndarray: A 3D NumPy array representing the image. If the input is a 2D array,\n                it is converted to a 3D array by repeating the grayscale values across\n                three channels.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Check if the input is a 2D array (grayscale image)\n    if image_arr.ndim == 2:\n        # 2. Convert the 2D grayscale image to a 3D array by repeating the values\n        #    across three channels (RGB-like format)\n        image_arr = np.stack([image_arr] * 3, axis=-1)\n    \n    # 3. If the input is a 3D array, validate its dimensions\n    elif image_arr.ndim == 3:\n        # 4.

Return the processed 3D image array\n    return image_arr\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Check Input Dimensions**: The function first checks if the input image array is 2D (grayscale). If so, it converts it to a 3D array by stacking the grayscale values across three channels.\n\n2. **Validate 3D Input**: If the input is already a 3D array, the function checks that the third dimension has a size of 3, ensuring it is in RGB format.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: If the input is neither 2D nor 3D, the function raises a `ValueError` to indicate an invalid input format.\n\n4. **Return Processed Image**: Finally, the function returns the processed 3D image array, ready for use in CNNs.",
