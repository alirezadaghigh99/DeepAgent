    "result": "To create a Python function called `hamming_distance` that calculates the Hamming distance between two hash strings, we can follow a step-by-step approach similar to the examples provided. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef hamming_distance(hash1: str, hash2: str) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Hamming distance between two hash strings.\n\n    The function pads the hashes to 64 bits if they are not already,\n    and then calculates the Hamming distance.\n\n    Args:\n        hash1 (str): The first hash string.\n        hash2 (str): The second hash string.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The Hamming distance between the two hashes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define the target length for the hashes\n    target_length = 64\n\n    # 2. Pad the hashes to ensure they are 64 bits long\n    hash1 = hash1.ljust(target_length, '0')\n    hash2 = hash2.ljust(target_length, '0')\n\n    # 3. Ensure both hashes are of the same length\n    if len(hash1) != len(hash2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Hashes must be of the same length after padding.\")\n\n    # 4. Initialize a counter for the Hamming distance\n    distance = 0\n\n    # 5. Iterate over each character in the hashes\n    for char1, char2 in zip(hash1, hash2):\n        # 6. Increment the distance for each differing character\n        if char1 != char2:\n            distance += 1\n\n    # 7. Return the calculated Hamming distance\n    return float(distance)\n\n# Example usage:\n# hash1 = \"1101\"\n# hash2 = \"1001\"\n# print(hamming_distance(hash1, hash2))  # Output: 1.0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Define the Target Length**: We set the target length for the hashes to 64 bits.\n\n2. **Pad the Hashes**: We use the `ljust` method to pad each hash with zeros to ensure they are 64 bits long. This is done by appending '0' characters to the right of the hash until it reaches the target length.\n\n3. **Check Length Consistency**: After padding, we ensure both hashes are of the same length. If not, we raise a `ValueError`.\n\n4. **Initialize Distance Counter**: We initialize a counter `distance` to keep track of the number of differing characters between the two hashes.\n\n5. **Iterate and Compare**: We iterate over each character in the hashes using `zip` to pair corresponding characters from `hash1` and `hash2`. For each pair, we check if the characters differ and increment the `distance` counter if they do.\n\n6. **Return the Distance**: Finally, we return the calculated Hamming distance as a float.\n\nThis function will correctly calculate the Hamming distance between two hash strings, even if they are initially shorter than 64 bits.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called hamming_distance that calculates the Hamming distance between two hash strings. The function takes two input parameters, hash1 and hash2, both of type string. The function returns a float value representing the Hamming distance between the two hashes. If the length of the hashes is not 64 bits, the function pads the length to be 64 for each hash before calculating the Hamming distance. The output is the calculated Hamming distance between the two hashes.",
