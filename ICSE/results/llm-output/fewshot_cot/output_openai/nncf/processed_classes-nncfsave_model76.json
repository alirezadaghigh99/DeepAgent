    "result": "To implement the `save_model` function for the `DDPG` class, you need to save the state dictionaries of the actor and critic networks to files named `actor.pkl` and `critic.pkl` in the specified output directory. Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing this function:\n\n1. **Import Required Libraries**: You will need the `os` module to handle directory paths and the `torch` module to save the model state dictionaries.\n\n2. **Check and Create Output Directory**: Ensure that the specified output directory exists. If it doesn't, create it.\n\n3. **Save the Actor and Critic State Dictionaries**: Use `torch.save` to save the state dictionaries of the actor and critic networks to the specified files.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport torch\n\nclass DDPG:\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.actor = None  # actor network\n        self.critic = None  # critic network\n        # Initialize actor and critic networks here\n        pass\n\n    def save_model(self, output):\n        \"\"\"\n        Save the weights of the actor and critic networks to the specified output directory.\n\n        Args:\n            output (str): The directory where the model weights will be saved.\n        \"\"\"\n        # 1. Ensure the output directory exists\n        if not os.path.exists(output):\n            os.makedirs(output)\n\n        # 2. Define the file paths for saving the actor and critic state dictionaries\n        actor_path = os.path.join(output, 'actor.pkl')\n        critic_path = os.path.join(output, 'critic.pkl')\n\n        # 3. Save the actor's state dictionary\n        torch.save(self.actor.state_dict(), actor_path)\n\n        # 4. Save the critic's state dictionary\n        torch.save(self.critic.state_dict(), critic_path)\n\n        print(f\"Model saved: Actor -> {actor_path}, Critic -> {critic_path}\")\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Step 1**: Import the necessary modules. `os` is used for file path operations, and `torch` is used to save the model weights.\n  \n- **Step 2**: Check if the output directory exists using `os.path.exists()`. If it doesn't, create it using `os.makedirs()`.\n\n- **Step 3**: Construct the file paths for the actor and critic state dictionaries using `os.path.join()`.\n\n- **Step 4**: Use `torch.save()` to save the state dictionaries of the actor and critic networks to the specified file paths.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the `actor` and `critic` attributes of the `DDPG` class are PyTorch models with a `state_dict()` method, which is typical for PyTorch neural network modules.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `save_model` for the class `DDPG` that saves the weights of the actor and critic networks to a specified output directory. The function should save the actor's state dictionary as `actor.pkl` and the critic's state dictionary as `critic.pkl` within the given output directory.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass DDPG:\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.actor = None  # actor network\n        self.critic = None  # critic network\n        pass\n\n    def save_model(self, output):\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```\n\nThis function will save the model's actor and critic networks' weights to the specified output directory, ensuring that the models can be reloaded later.",
