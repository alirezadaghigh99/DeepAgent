    "result": "To implement the `select_action` function for the `DDPG` class, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Predict the Action**: Use the actor network to predict the action based on the current state `s_t`.\n\n2. **Apply Noise**: If `decay_epsilon` is `True`, apply noise to the predicted action. The noise should be sampled from a truncated normal distribution with a decaying standard deviation (`self.delta`).\n\n3. **Decay the Noise**: Update the noise standard deviation (`self.delta`) by multiplying it with the decay rate (`self.delta_decay`).\n\n4. **Clip the Action**: Ensure the action is within the bounds defined by `LBOUND` and `RBOUND`.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import truncnorm\n\nclass DDPG:\n    LBOUND = 0.0\n    RBOUND = 1.0\n\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.actor = None  # actor network\n        self.init_delta = 0.5  # initial delta for noise\n        self.delta_decay = 0.995  # decay rate for delta\n        self.warmup_iter_number = 20  # number of warmup iterations\n        self.nb_actions = nb_actions  # number of actions\n        self.delta = self.init_delta  # current delta for noise\n\n    def select_action(self, s_t, episode, decay_epsilon=True):\n        # 1. Use the actor network to predict the action\n        action = self.actor.predict(s_t)\n\n        # 2. Apply noise if decay_epsilon is True\n        if decay_epsilon:\n            # Sample noise from a truncated normal distribution\n            noise = self._sample_truncated_normal(mean=0, std=self.delta, size=self.nb_actions)\n            action += noise\n\n            # 3. Decay the noise standard deviation\n            self.delta *= self.delta_decay\n\n        # 4. Clip the action to be within the bounds\n        action = np.clip(action, self.LBOUND, self.RBOUND)\n\n        return action\n\n    def _sample_truncated_normal(self, mean, std, size):\n        # Define the bounds for the truncated normal distribution\n        lower, upper = -2 * std, 2 * std\n        # Sample from the truncated normal distribution\n        return truncnorm.rvs((lower - mean) / std, (upper - mean) / std, loc=mean, scale=std, size=size)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Actor Network Prediction**: The `actor.predict(s_t)` method is assumed to be a placeholder for the actual prediction method of the actor network. You should replace it with the appropriate method call for your actor network.\n\n- **Noise Application**: The noise is sampled from a truncated normal distribution to ensure it remains within a reasonable range. The `_sample_truncated_normal` method uses `scipy.stats.truncnorm` to generate this noise.\n\n- **Noise Decay**: The noise standard deviation (`self.delta`) is decayed by multiplying it with `self.delta_decay` after each action selection.\n\n- **Action Clipping**: The `np.clip` function ensures that the action values remain within the specified bounds (`LBOUND` and `RBOUND`).",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `select_action` for the class `DDPG` that selects an action based on the current state `s_t` and the current episode number. The function should use the actor network to predict the action, and if `decay_epsilon` is `True`, it should apply noise to the action by sampling from a truncated normal distribution with a decaying standard deviation (`self.delta`). The function should then clip the action to be within the bounds defined by `LBOUND` and `RBOUND`.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass DDPG:\n    LBOUND = 0.0\n    RBOUND = 1.0\n\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.actor = None  # actor network\n        self.init_delta = 0.5  # initial delta for noise\n        self.delta_decay = 0.995  # decay rate for delta\n        self.warmup_iter_number = 20  # number of warmup iterations\n        self.nb_actions = nb_actions  # number of actions\n        pass\n\n    def select_action(self, s_t, episode, decay_epsilon=True):\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```\n\nThis function should output a clipped action that is within the defined bounds, applying noise to encourage exploration during training.",
