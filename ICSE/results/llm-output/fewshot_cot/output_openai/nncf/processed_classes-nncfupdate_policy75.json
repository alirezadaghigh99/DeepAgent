    "result": "To implement the `update_policy` function for the `DDPG` class, we need to follow several steps. These steps include sampling a batch of experiences from the replay buffer, normalizing the rewards, calculating the target Q-values, updating the critic and actor networks, and performing a soft update on the target networks. Additionally, we will update the internal attributes `value_loss` and `policy_loss` for logging purposes. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nclass DDPG:\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.memory = None  # replay buffer\n        self.actor = None  # actor network\n        self.actor_target = None  # target actor network\n        self.actor_optim = None  # optimizer for actor network\n        self.critic = None  # critic network\n        self.critic_target = None  # target critic network\n        self.critic_optim = None  # optimizer for critic network\n        self.batch_size = None  # batch size for training\n        self.discount = None  # discount factor\n        self.moving_average = None  # moving average of rewards\n        self.moving_alpha = None  # smoothing factor for moving average\n        self.value_loss = 0.0  # loss for critic network\n        self.policy_loss = 0.0  # loss for actor network\n        self.tau = None  # soft update parameter\n        pass\n\n    def update_policy(self):\n        # 1. Sample a batch of experiences from the replay buffer\n        states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones = self.memory.sample(self.batch_size)\n\n        # 2. Normalize the rewards\n        if self.moving_average is None:\n            self.moving_average = rewards.mean()\n        else:\n            self.moving_average = self.moving_alpha * rewards.mean() + (1 - self.moving_alpha) * self.moving_average\n        rewards = rewards / (self.moving_average + 1e-8)\n\n        # 3. Calculate the target Q-values for the critic\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            next_actions = self.actor_target(next_states)\n            target_q_values = self.critic_target(next_states, next_actions)\n            target_q_values = rewards + (1 - dones) * self.discount * target_q_values\n\n        # 4. Update the critic network\n        current_q_values = self.critic(states, actions)\n        value_loss = F.mse_loss(current_q_values, target_q_values)\n        self.critic_optim.zero_grad()\n        value_loss.backward()\n        self.critic_optim.step()\n\n        # 5. Update the actor network\n        predicted_actions = self.actor(states)\n        policy_loss = -self.critic(states, predicted_actions).mean()\n        self.actor_optim.zero_grad()\n        policy_loss.backward()\n        self.actor_optim.step()\n\n        # 6. Perform a soft update on the target networks\n        self.soft_update(self.critic, self.critic_target, self.tau)\n        self.soft_update(self.actor, self.actor_target, self.tau)\n\n        # 7. Update the internal attributes for logging\n        self.value_loss = value_loss.item()\n        self.policy_loss = policy_loss.item()\n\n    def soft_update(self, source, target, tau):\n        for target_param, source_param in zip(target.parameters(), source.parameters()):\n            target_param.data.copy_(tau * source_param.data + (1.0 - tau) * target_param.data)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Sampling from Replay Buffer**: We sample a batch of experiences, which includes states, actions, rewards, next states, and done flags.\n\n2. **Normalizing Rewards**: We normalize the rewards using a moving average to stabilize training.\n\n3. **Target Q-Values**: We compute the target Q-values using the target networks and the Bellman equation.\n\n4. **Critic Update**: We calculate the loss for the critic network using mean squared error and update the critic network.\n\n5. **Actor Update**: We calculate the policy loss for the actor network and update it.\n\n6. **Soft Update**: We perform a soft update on the target networks to slowly track the learned networks.\n\n7. **Logging**: We update the `value_loss` and `policy_loss` attributes for logging purposes.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the replay buffer, networks, and optimizers are properly initialized and that the `soft_update` method is defined to perform the soft update of the target networks.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `update_policy` for the class `DDPG` that updates the actor and critic networks based on a sampled batch of experiences from the replay buffer. The function should normalize the reward, calculate the target Q-values for the critic, and then update the critic and actor networks accordingly. After updating the networks, it should also perform a soft update on the target networks. The function should update the internal attributes `value_loss` and `policy_loss` for logging purposes.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass DDPG:\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.memory = None  # replay buffer\n        self.actor = None  # actor network\n        self.actor_target = None  # target actor network\n        self.actor_optim = None  # optimizer for actor network\n        self.critic = None  # critic network\n        self.critic_target = None  # target critic network\n        self.critic_optim = None  # optimizer for critic network\n        self.batch_size = None  # batch size for training\n        self.discount = None  # discount factor\n        self.moving_average = None  # moving average of rewards\n        self.moving_alpha = None  # smoothing factor for moving average\n        self.value_loss = 0.0  # loss for critic network\n        self.policy_loss = 0.0  # loss for actor network\n        pass\n\n    def update_policy(self):\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
