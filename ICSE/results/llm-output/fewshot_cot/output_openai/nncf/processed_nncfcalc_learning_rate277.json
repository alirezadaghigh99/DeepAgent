    "result": "To implement the `calc_learning_rate` function, we need to consider the inputs and the logic for calculating the learning rate based on the specified schedule type. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to implement this function:\n\n1. **Define the Function Signature**: The function will take several parameters, including the current epoch, initial learning rate, total epochs, current batch, total batches per epoch, and the learning rate schedule type.\n\n2. **Handle the Default Schedule Type**: If the schedule type is \"cosine,\" we will calculate the learning rate using a cosine annealing schedule.\n\n3. **Implement the Cosine Annealing Schedule**: This schedule typically involves using a cosine function to smoothly decrease the learning rate from the initial value to zero over the course of training.\n\n4. **Handle Unsupported Schedule Types**: If an unsupported schedule type is provided, raise a `ValueError`.\n\n5. **Return the Calculated Learning Rate**: The function should return the calculated learning rate as a float.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `calc_learning_rate` function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calc_learning_rate(\n    current_epoch: int,\n    initial_lr: float,\n    total_epochs: int,\n    current_batch: int,\n    total_batches_per_epoch: int,\n    lr_schedule_type: str = \"cosine\"\n) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the learning rate based on the provided schedule type.\n\n    Args:\n        current_epoch (int): The current epoch number.\n        initial_lr (float): The initial learning rate.\n        total_epochs (int): The total number of epochs.\n        current_batch (int): The current batch number within the epoch.\n        total_batches_per_epoch (int): The total number of batches per epoch.\n        lr_schedule_type (str): The learning rate schedule type.

The formula used is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{lr} = \\text{initial\\_lr} \\times 0.5 \\times (1 + \\cos(\\pi \\times \\text{progress}))\n  \\]\n  where `progress` is the fraction of total training steps completed.\n\n- **Constant Schedule**: If the schedule type is \"constant,\" the function simply returns the initial learning rate.\n\n- **Error Handling**: If an unsupported schedule type is provided, the function raises a `ValueError` with a descriptive message.",
    "prompt": "You need to implement a function called `calc_learning_rate` that calculates the learning rate during training based on the provided schedule type. The function takes inputs for the current epoch, initial learning rate, total epochs, current batch, total batches per epoch, and the learning rate schedule type, which defaults to \"cosine.\" If \"cosine\" is selected, the learning rate should be calculated using a cosine annealing schedule; otherwise, if no schedule type is provided, return the initial learning rate. If an unsupported schedule type is given, raise ValueError(\"do not support: %s\" % lr_schedule_type) The function outputs the calculated learning rate as a float.",
