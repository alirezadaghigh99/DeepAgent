If the range is narrow, we use `2^bits - 1` levels; otherwise, we use `2^bits`.\n\n2. **Step Size Calculation**: \n   - The step size for quantization is calculated by dividing the range length (`range_len`) by the number of quantization levels (`quants_count`).\n\n3. **Minimum Adjustment Calculation**: \n   - The minimum adjustment value is calculated by adding the step size to the lower bound (`low`).\n\n4. **Return Value**: \n   - The function returns the calculated minimum adjustment value.\n\nThis function provides a straightforward way to compute the minimum adjustment value based on the given parameters, which can be useful in quantization processes.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called _min_adj that calculates the minimum adjustment value based on the input parameters. The function takes in the number of bits (bits), the lower bound (low), the length of the range (range_len), and a boolean value indicating whether the range is narrow (narrow_range). The function calculates the number of quantization levels (quants_count), and then returns the result",
