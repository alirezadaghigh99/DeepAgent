    "result": "To implement the `update_delta_decay_factor` function for the `DDPG` class, we need to follow the specified behavior for updating the delta decay factor based on the number of training episodes. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to implement this function:\n\n1. **Check for Valid Input**: Ensure that the number of training episodes is greater than zero. If not, raise an assertion error.\n\n2. **Define Calibrated Values for Episodes Below 1000**: Set specific decay factors for episodes below 1000. This could be a predefined list or a function that maps episode numbers to decay factors.\n\n3. **Linear Interpolation for Episodes Between 1000 and 3000**: Implement a linear interpolation to smoothly transition the decay factor between two values for episodes in this range.\n\n4. **Constant Decay Factor for Episodes Beyond 3000**: Set a constant decay factor for episodes greater than 3000.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nclass DDPG:\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.delta_decay = None  # Initialize the delta decay factor\n        pass\n\n    def update_delta_decay_factor(self, num_train_episode):\n        # 1. Check for valid input\n        assert num_train_episode > 0, \"Number of training episodes must be greater than zero.\"\n\n        # 2. Define calibrated values for episodes below 1000\n        if num_train_episode < 1000:\n            # Example calibrated values (these should be defined based on your specific needs)\n            calibrated_values = [0.9, 0.85, 0.8, 0.75, 0.7]  # Example values\n            index = min(num_train_episode // 200, len(calibrated_values) - 1)\n            self.delta_decay = calibrated_values[index]\n\n        # 3. Linear interpolation for episodes between 1000 and 3000\n        elif 1000 <= num_train_episode <= 3000:\n            start_decay = 0.7  # Example start value\n            end_decay = 0.5    # Example end value\n            self.delta_decay = start_decay + (end_decay - start_decay) * ((num_train_episode - 1000) / 2000)\n\n        # 4. Constant decay factor for episodes beyond 3000\n        else:\n            self.delta_decay = 0.5  # Example constant value\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Calibrated Values**: For episodes below 1000, we use a list of predefined decay factors. The index is determined by dividing the episode number by 200, ensuring we don't exceed the list's bounds.\n- **Linear Interpolation**: For episodes between 1000 and 3000, we calculate the decay factor using a linear interpolation formula. This smoothly transitions the decay factor from `start_decay` to `end_decay`.\n- **Constant Value**: For episodes beyond 3000, the decay factor is set to a constant value.\n\nAdjust the calibrated values, start, and end decay values according to your specific requirements.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `update_delta_decay_factor` for the class `DDPG` that updates the delta decay factor based on the number of training episodes. The function adjusts the decay factor according to specific calibrated values for episodes below 1000, a linear interpolation for episodes between 1000 and 3000, and sets a constant decay factor for episodes beyond 3000.
