    "result": "To complete the `position_embedding` function, we need to generate a sine/cosine position embedding for each position in the input tensor `pos`. The embedding dimension `embed_dim` must be even, as it will be split equally between sine and cosine components.

Must be even.\n        pos: A list of positions to be encoded, of size (M,).\n\n    Returns:\n        Position embeddings of size (M, D).\n\n    Raises:\n        AssertionError: If *embed_dim* is not even.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Ensure the embedding dimension is even\n    assert embed_dim % 2 == 0, \"Embedding dimension must be even.\"\n\n    # 2. Create a tensor of frequencies for the sine and cosine functions\n    #    The frequencies are scaled by the embedding dimension\n    half_dim = embed_dim // 2\n    div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, half_dim, 2).float() * (-torch.log(torch.tensor(10000.0)) / half_dim))\n\n    # 3. Compute the position embeddings\n    #    Use broadcasting to apply the sine and cosine functions to the positions\n    pos = pos.unsqueeze(1)  # Shape (M, 1)\n    pos_embedding = torch.zeros((pos.size(0), embed_dim))\n\n    # 4. Apply sine to the even indices and cosine to the odd indices\n    pos_embedding[:, 0:half_dim:2] = torch.sin(pos * div_term)\n    pos_embedding[:, 1:half_dim:2] = torch.cos(pos * div_term)\n\n    # 5. Return the position embeddings\n    return pos_embedding\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Ensure Even Dimension**: The function starts by asserting that `embed_dim` is even, as the sine and cosine components will each take half of the dimensions.\n\n2. **Frequency Calculation**: A tensor `div_term` is created to hold the frequencies for the sine and cosine functions. These frequencies are scaled logarithmically to cover a wide range of values.\n\n3. **Position Embedding Calculation**: The input positions `pos` are expanded to a 2D tensor to facilitate broadcasting. The `pos_embedding` tensor is initialized to store the final embeddings.\n\n4. **Sine and Cosine Application**: The sine function is applied to the even indices of the embedding, and the cosine function is applied to the odd indices. This creates a unique embedding for each position.\n\n5. **Return Embeddings**: Finally, the function returns the computed position embeddings.",
