    "result": "To implement the `forward` method for the `FCN` class, you need to pass the input tensor through the network's layers and return the final output. Here's how you can complete the `forward` method:\n\n```python\n    def forward(self, x: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # Pass the input through the backbone of the network\n        x = self.backbone(x)\n        \n        # Pass the result through the final convolutional layer\n        x = self.last(x)\n        \n        # Return the output tensor\n        return x\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Backbone Processing**: The input tensor `x` is passed through the `backbone`, which consists of a sequence of convolutional layers followed by Leaky ReLU activations. This sequence is defined in the `__init__` method using `nn.modules.Sequential`.\n\n2. **Final Convolution**: After processing through the backbone, the tensor is passed through the `last` convolutional layer. This layer reduces the number of channels to the desired number of output classes.\n\n3. **Return Output**: The final output tensor is returned. It has the shape `[N, classes, H, W]`, where `N` is the batch size, `classes` is the number of output classes, and `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input tensor, respectively.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the network performs a forward pass through all layers, applying the necessary transformations to the input tensor.",
