    "result": "To implement the `_normalize` method for the `RCF` class that performs ZCA whitening on a set of input patches, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Remove the Mean**: Subtract the mean of each patch to center the data.\n2. **Normalize to Unit Norms**: Scale each patch so that its norm is 1.\n3. **ZCA Whitening**: Apply ZCA whitening to decorrelate the features.\n\nHere's how you can implement this method:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nclass RCF:\n    def __init__(self, in_channels: int = 4, features: int = 16, kernel_size: int = 3, bias: float = -1.0, seed: int | None = None, mode: str = 'gaussian', dataset: NonGeoDataset | None = None):\n        self.weights = ...\n        self.biases = ...\n        pass\n\n    def _normalize(self, patches: np.typing.NDArray[np.float32], min_divisor: float = 1e-8, zca_bias: float = 0.001) -> np.typing.NDArray[np.float32]:\n        # 1. Remove the mean from each patch\n        mean = np.mean(patches, axis=(1, 2, 3), keepdims=True)\n        patches_centered = patches - mean\n\n        # 2. Normalize each patch to have unit norm\n        norms = np.linalg.norm(patches_centered, axis=(1, 2, 3), keepdims=True)\n        # Avoid division by zero by using max(norms, min_divisor)\n        patches_normalized = patches_centered / np.maximum(norms, min_divisor)\n\n        # 3. Reshape patches to (N, C*H*W) for covariance computation\n        N, C, H, W = patches_normalized.shape\n        patches_flat = patches_normalized.reshape(N, -1)\n\n        # 4. Compute the covariance matrix\n        covariance_matrix = np.cov(patches_flat, rowvar=False)\n\n        # 5. Add zca_bias to the diagonal for numerical stability\n        covariance_matrix += np.eye(covariance_matrix.shape[0]) * zca_bias\n\n        # 6. Perform Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)\n        U, S, V = np.linalg.svd(covariance_matrix)\n\n        # 7. Compute the ZCA whitening matrix\n        zca_matrix = U @ np.diag(1.0 / np.sqrt(S + zca_bias)) @ U.T\n\n        # 8. Apply the ZCA whitening matrix\n        patches_whitened = patches_flat @ zca_matrix\n\n        # 9. Reshape back to the original shape (N, C, H, W)\n        patches_whitened = patches_whitened.reshape(N, C, H, W)\n\n        return patches_whitened\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Mean Removal**: We compute the mean of each patch and subtract it to center the data.\n- **Normalization**: We compute the norm of each patch and divide by it to ensure each patch has a unit norm. We use `np.maximum(norms, min_divisor)` to prevent division by zero.\n- **ZCA Whitening**: We compute the covariance matrix of the flattened patches, add a small bias to the diagonal for numerical stability, and perform SVD to obtain the ZCA whitening matrix. We then apply this matrix to the flattened patches and reshape them back to their original shape.\n\nThis method should effectively normalize the input patches using ZCA whitening, following the steps outlined in the `mosaiks-paper` repository.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `_normalize` for the `RCF` class that performs ZCA whitening on a set of input patches. The method should normalize the patches by removing the mean, normalizing the patches to have unit norms, and then applying ZCA whitening. The method should take as input a NumPy array `patches` of shape `(N, C, H, W)` and return a normalized NumPy array of the same shape. Additional parameters should include `min_divisor` to prevent division by zero and `zca_bias` to add a small bias during whitening. The method should follow the ZCA whitening steps as specified in the `mosaiks-paper` repository.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass RCF:\n    def __init__(self, in_channels: int = 4, features: int = 16, kernel_size: int = 3, bias: float = -1.0, seed: int | None = None, mode: str = 'gaussian', dataset: NonGeoDataset | None = None):\n        self.weights = ...\n        self.biases = ...\n        pass\n\n    def _normalize(self, patches: np.typing.NDArray[np.float32], min_divisor: float = 1e-8, zca_bias: float = 0.001) -> np.typing.NDArray[np.float32]:\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
