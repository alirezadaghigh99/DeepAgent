    "result": "To implement the `_full_weighted_product` function, we need to compute the weighted product of the input tensors `X` and `X2` using the `weight_variances` and `bias_variance` attributes. If `X2` is `None`, the function should compute the weighted product of `X` with itself. Here's a step-by-step implementation:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass ArcCosine:\n    def __init__(self, weight_variances: tf.Tensor, bias_variance: tf.Tensor):\n        self.weight_variances = weight_variances\n        self.bias_variance = bias_variance\n\n    def _full_weighted_product(self, X: tf.Tensor, X2: Optional[tf.Tensor] = None) -> tf.Tensor:\n        \"\"\"\n        Compute the full weighted product of the input tensors X and X2 using\n        the weight_variances and bias_variance attributes. If X2 is None, compute\n        the weighted product of X with itself.\n\n        Args:\n            X (tf.Tensor): Input tensor.\n            X2 (Optional[tf.Tensor]): Optional second input tensor.\n\n        Returns:\n            tf.Tensor: The weighted product tensor.\n        \"\"\"\n        # 1. If X2 is None, set it to X for self-product\n        if X2 is None:\n            X2 = X\n\n        # 2. Compute the weighted product\n        #    - Multiply X and X2 by the weight_variances\n        #    - Add the bias_variance\n        weighted_X = X * self.weight_variances\n        weighted_X2 = X2 * self.weight_variances\n\n        # 3. Compute the dot product between weighted_X and weighted_X2\n        product = tf.matmul(weighted_X, weighted_X2, transpose_b=True)\n\n        # 4. Add the bias_variance to the product\n        weighted_product = product + self.bias_variance\n\n        # 5. Return the resulting weighted product tensor\n        return weighted_product\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `ArcCosine` class is initialized with `weight_variances` and `bias_variance`, which are used in the computation.\n\n2. **Handling `X2`**: If `X2` is `None`, it is set to `X` to compute the weighted product of `X` with itself.\n\n3. **Weighting**: Each input tensor (`X` and `X2`) is multiplied by `weight_variances` to apply the weights.\n\n4. **Dot Product**: The dot product of the weighted tensors is computed using `tf.matmul`, with `transpose_b=True` to ensure the correct dimensions for matrix multiplication.\n\n5. **Bias Addition**: The `bias_variance` is added to the result of the dot product to complete the weighted product computation.\n\n6. **Return**: The function returns the computed weighted product tensor.",
