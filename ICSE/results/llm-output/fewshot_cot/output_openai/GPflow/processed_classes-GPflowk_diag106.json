    "result": "To create the `K_diag` function for the `ArcCosine` class, we need to follow a structured approach similar to the examples provided.

It takes a tensor `X` as input and returns a tensor representing the diagonal of the kernel matrix.\n\n2. **Weighted Product Calculation**: The `_diag_weighted_product` method is used to compute a weighted product of the input tensor `X`. This method should be implemented based on the specific requirements of the ArcCosine kernel.\n\n3. **Transformation with _J Method**: The `_J` method is applied to the weighted product to compute the diagonal elements. This method typically involves some transformation or activation function specific to the kernel.\n\n4. **Return Statement**: The function returns the computed diagonal elements as a tensor.\n\n5. **Placeholder Methods**: The `_diag_weighted_product` and `_J` methods are placeholders and should be implemented with the actual logic required for the ArcCosine kernel. The example implementations provided are for illustrative purposes and should be replaced with the correct computations.",
