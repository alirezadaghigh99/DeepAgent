    "result": "To complete the function `gh_points_and_weights`, you need to calculate the Gauss-Hermite quadrature points and weights. This involves using a numerical method to approximate integrals of the form given in the docstring. The Gauss-Hermite quadrature is particularly useful for integrals involving the Gaussian weight function.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function using TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\ndef gh_points_and_weights(n_gh: int) -> Tuple[tf.Tensor, tf.Tensor]:\n    r\"\"\"\n    Given the number of Gauss-Hermite points n_gh,\n    returns the points z and the weights dz to perform the following\n    uni-dimensional gaussian quadrature:\n\n    X ~ N(mean, stddev\u00b2)\n    E[f(X)] = \u222b f(x) p(x) dx = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_gh} f(mean + stddev*z_i) dz_i\n\n    :param n_gh: Number of Gauss-Hermite points\n    :returns: Points z and weights dz to compute uni-dimensional gaussian expectation\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Use numpy to compute the Gauss-Hermite quadrature points and weights\n    z, dz = np.polynomial.hermite.hermgauss(n_gh)\n\n    # 2. Convert the numpy arrays to TensorFlow tensors\n    z_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(z, dtype=tf.float32)\n    dz_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(dz, dtype=tf.float32)\n\n    # 3. Return the points and weights as TensorFlow tensors\n    return z_tensor, dz_tensor\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Gauss-Hermite Quadrature**: The function uses `numpy.polynomial.hermite.hermgauss` to compute the Gauss-Hermite quadrature points and weights. This function returns the roots of the Hermite polynomial (the points) and the corresponding weights for the quadrature.\n\n2. **Conversion to TensorFlow Tensors**: Since the function is expected to return TensorFlow tensors, the numpy arrays are converted to TensorFlow tensors using `tf.convert_to_tensor`.\n\n3. **Return**: The function returns the points and weights as TensorFlow tensors, which can be used in further TensorFlow computations.\n\nThis implementation assumes that you have TensorFlow and NumPy installed in your environment. The Gauss-Hermite quadrature is useful for approximating integrals of functions weighted by a Gaussian function, which is common in probabilistic and statistical computations.",
