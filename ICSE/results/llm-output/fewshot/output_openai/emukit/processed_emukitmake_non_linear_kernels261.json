    "result": "To create a function `make_non_linear_kernels` that constructs a list of structured multi-fidelity kernels using a specified base kernel class from GPy, you can follow the instructions provided. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport GPy\n\ndef make_non_linear_kernels(base_kernel_class, n_fidelities, n_input_dims, ARD=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs a list of structured multi-fidelity kernels using a specified base kernel class from GPy.\n\n    Args:\n        base_kernel_class: The GPy kernel class to use.\n        n_fidelities: Number of fidelity levels.\n        n_input_dims: Number of input dimensions.\n        ARD: Boolean indicating whether to use Automatic Relevance Determination.\n\n    Returns:\n        List of kernels, with one kernel per fidelity level, starting from the lowest to the highest fidelity.\n    \"\"\"\n    kernels = []\n\n    # Create the first fidelity kernel\n    kernel = base_kernel_class(input_dim=n_input_dims, ARD=ARD)\n    kernels.append(kernel)\n\n    # Create subsequent fidelity kernels\n    for i in range(1, n_fidelities):\n        # Multiply the base kernel applied to the current fidelity with the base kernel applied to the previous fidelity\n        # and add another base kernel for bias\n        kernel = (base_kernel_class(input_dim=n_input_dims, ARD=ARD) * kernels[i - 1]) + base_kernel_class(input_dim=n_input_dims, ARD=ARD)\n        kernels.append(kernel)\n\n    return kernels\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Parameters**:\n   - `base_kernel_class`: The GPy kernel class to use (e.g., `GPy.kern.RBF`).\n   - `n_fidelities`: Number of fidelity levels.\n   - `n_input_dims`: Number of input dimensions.\n   - `ARD`: Boolean indicating whether to use Automatic Relevance Determination (default is `False`).\n\n2. **Kernel Construction**:\n   - The first fidelity kernel is simply the base kernel applied to the input dimensions.\n   - For subsequent fidelities, the kernel is constructed by multiplying the base kernel applied to the current fidelity with the base kernel applied to the previous fidelity, and adding another base kernel for bias.\n\n3. **Return**:\n   - The function returns a list of kernels, with one kernel per fidelity level, starting from the lowest to the highest fidelity.\n\nThis function allows you to create a structured multi-fidelity kernel setup, which can be useful in scenarios where you have data of varying fidelity levels and want to model them using Gaussian processes.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function `make_non_linear_kernels` that constructs a list of structured multi-fidelity kernels using a specified base kernel class from GPy. The function should accept the following parameters: `base_kernel_class` (the GPy kernel class to use), `n_fidelities` (number of fidelity levels), `n_input_dims` (number of input dimensions), and `ARD` (a boolean indicating whether to use Automatic Relevance Determination, i.e., different lengthscales for different dimensions). The function should return a list of kernels, with one kernel per fidelity level, starting from the lowest to the highest fidelity. For the first fidelity, the kernel is simply the base kernel applied to the input dimensions. For subsequent fidelities, the kernel is constructed by multiplying the base kernel applied to the current fidelity with the base kernel applied to the previous fidelity, and adding another base kernel for bias. Default value of ARD is False",
