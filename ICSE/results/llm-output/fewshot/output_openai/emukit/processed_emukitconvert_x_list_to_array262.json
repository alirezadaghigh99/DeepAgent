If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n- **Appending Fidelity Index**: For each array in `x_list`, it appends a column filled with the current fidelity index (which is the position of the array in the list).\n- **Concatenation**: It concatenates all the modified arrays vertically to form the final output array.\n- **Output**: The function returns a single numpy array with the features and fidelity index concatenated.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called convert_x_list_to_array that takes in a list of numpy arrays called x_list and returns a numpy array with all features and the zero-based fidelity index appended as the last column. The input should be a list of numpy arrays with dimensions (n_points x n_dims) ordered from lowest to highest fidelity. The output should be a numpy array with the features and fidelity index concatenated. If any of the arrays in x_list do not have 2 dimensions, a ValueError should be raised. raise value error of All x arrays must have 2 dimensions",
