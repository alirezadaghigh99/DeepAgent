    "result": "To create a function called `nearest_neighbors` that computes the nearest points for each data point in `X` using a specified metric, we can leverage libraries like `scikit-learn` for efficient nearest neighbor search. Here's a possible implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors\nfrom sklearn.utils import check_random_state\n\ndef nearest_neighbors(X, n_neighbors=5, metric='euclidean', metric_params=None, \n                      use_angular_rp_trees=False, random_state=None, \n                      low_memory=False, verbose=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the n_neighbors nearest points for each data point in X under a specified metric.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - X: array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)\n        The input data.\n    - n_neighbors: int, default=5\n        Number of nearest neighbors to compute.\n    - metric: str or callable, default='euclidean'\n        The distance metric to use for the tree.\n    - metric_params: dict, default=None\n        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.\n    - use_angular_rp_trees: bool, default=False\n        Whether to use angular random projection trees for approximation.\n    - random_state: int, RandomState instance or None, default=None\n        Random state for approximate computations.\n    - low_memory: bool, default=False\n        If True, use a memory-efficient algorithm.\n    - verbose: bool, default=False\n        If True, print status data during the computation.\n\n    Returns:\n    - knn_indices: array of shape (n_samples, n_neighbors)\n        Indices of the n_neighbors closest points in the dataset.\n    - knn_dists: array of shape (n_samples, n_neighbors)\n        Distances to the n_neighbors closest points in the dataset.\n    - rp_forest: list of trees or None\n        Random projection forest used for searching, or None if not used.\n    \"\"\"\n    if verbose:\n        print(\"Initializing nearest neighbors computation...\")\n\n    # Initialize the random state\n    rs = check_random_state(random_state)\n\n    # Initialize the NearestNeighbors model\n    nn_model = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=n_neighbors, metric=metric, \n                                metric_params=metric_params, algorithm='auto')\n    \n    if verbose:\n        print(\"Fitting the model to the data...\")\n\n    # Fit the model\n    nn_model.fit(X)\n\n    if verbose:\n        print(\"Computing the nearest neighbors...\")\n\n    # Find the nearest neighbors\n    knn_dists, knn_indices = nn_model.kneighbors(X)\n\n    # Placeholder for rp_forest, as sklearn's NearestNeighbors does not use it\n    rp_forest = None\n\n    if verbose:\n        print(\"Nearest neighbors computation completed.\")\n\n    return knn_indices, knn_dists, rp_forest\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `X`: The input data array.\n  - `n_neighbors`: Number of nearest neighbors to find.\n  - `metric`: The distance metric to use (e.g., 'euclidean', 'manhattan').\n  - `metric_params`: Additional parameters for the metric function.\n  - `use_angular_rp_trees`: Placeholder for using angular random projection trees (not implemented here).\n  - `random_state`: Seed for random number generation.\n  - `low_memory`: Placeholder for low memory usage (not implemented here).\n  - `verbose`: If `True`, prints status messages during computation.\n\n- **Returns**:\n  - `knn_indices`: Indices of the nearest neighbors.\n  - `knn_dists`: Distances to the nearest neighbors.\n  - `rp_forest`: Placeholder for random projection forest (not used in this implementation).\n\nThis function uses `scikit-learn`'s `NearestNeighbors` class to efficiently compute the nearest neighbors. The `use_angular_rp_trees` and `low_memory` options are placeholders, as implementing these would require a more complex setup, possibly involving custom algorithms or additional libraries.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called nearest_neighbors that computes the n_neighbors nearest points for each data point in X under a specified metric.

If verbose is set to True, the function will print status data during the computation.",
