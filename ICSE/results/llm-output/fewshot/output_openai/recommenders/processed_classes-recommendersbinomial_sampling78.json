    "result": "To implement the `binomial_sampling` function for the `RBM` class, you can use TensorFlow to perform the binomial sampling of hidden unit activations. The function will compare each probability in the input tensor `pr` with a random value sampled from a uniform distribution. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nclass RBM:\n    def __init__(self, possible_ratings, visible_units, hidden_units=500, keep_prob=0.7, init_stdv=0.1, learning_rate=0.004, minibatch_size=100, training_epoch=20, display_epoch=10, sampling_protocol=[50, 70, 80, 90, 100], debug=False, with_metrics=False, seed=42):\n        self.seed = seed\n        tf.random.set_seed(self.seed)\n\n    def binomial_sampling(self, pr):\n        \"\"\"\n        Perform binomial sampling of hidden unit activations using a rejection method.\n\n        Args:\n            pr (tf.Tensor): Tensor of shape (N, H) representing the conditional probabilities\n                            of the hidden units being active.\n\n        Returns:\n            tf.Tensor: Tensor of the same shape as `pr` with values of `1` or `0`.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Generate random values from a uniform distribution\n        random_values = tf.random.uniform(shape=tf.shape(pr), minval=0.0, maxval=1.0, dtype=tf.float32, seed=self.seed)\n        \n        # Compare the probabilities with the random values\n        sampled_activations = tf.cast(pr > random_values, dtype=tf.float32)\n        \n        return sampled_activations\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Random Values Generation**: We use `tf.random.uniform` to generate random values between 0 and 1 with the same shape as the input tensor `pr`.\n- **Comparison**: We compare each element in `pr` with the corresponding random value. If the probability is greater than the random value, the result is `1`; otherwise, it's `0`.\n- **Casting**: The result of the comparison is cast to `tf.float32` to ensure the output tensor has the same data type as the input.\n\nThis function will return a tensor of the same shape as `pr`, with each element being either `1` or `0`, representing the sampled activations of the hidden units.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `binomial_sampling` for the class `RBM` that performs binomial sampling of hidden unit activations using a rejection method. The function should take as input a tensor `pr`, which represents the conditional probabilities of the hidden units being active, and compare each probability with a random value sampled from a uniform distribution The input is `pr` (tf.Tensor, float32), and the output is a tensor of the same shape with values of `1` or `0`.\n```python\nclass RBM:\n    def __init__(self, possible_ratings, visible_units, hidden_units=500, keep_prob=0.7, init_stdv=0.1, learning_rate=0.004, minibatch_size=100, training_epoch=20, display_epoch=10, sampling_protocol=[50, 70, 80, 90, 100], debug=False, with_metrics=False, seed=42):\n        pass\n\n    def binomial_sampling(self, pr):\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
