    "result": "To implement the `multinomial_distribution` function for the `RBM` class, we need to calculate the probability that a visible unit `v` has a specific value `l` given a linear combination `phi` of the values from the previous layer. This involves using the softmax function to convert the linear combination into probabilities. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nclass RBM:\n    def __init__(self, possible_ratings, visible_units, hidden_units=500, keep_prob=0.7, init_stdv=0.1, learning_rate=0.004, minibatch_size=100, training_epoch=20, display_epoch=10, sampling_protocol=[50, 70, 80, 90, 100], debug=False, with_metrics=False, seed=42):\n        self.possible_ratings = possible_ratings\n        pass\n\n    def multinomial_distribution(self, phi):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the probability that a visible unit v has a specific value l given a linear combination phi.\n\n        Args:\n            phi (tf.Tensor): A tensor representing the linear combination of inputs.\n\n        Returns:\n            tf.Tensor: A tensor of shape (r, m, Nv) reshaped to (m, Nv, r).\n        \"\"\"\n        # Calculate the exponential of phi\n        exp_phi = tf.exp(phi)\n\n        # Sum over the possible ratings to normalize\n        sum_exp_phi = tf.reduce_sum(exp_phi, axis=0, keepdims=True)\n\n        # Calculate the probabilities using the softmax function\n        probabilities = exp_phi / sum_exp_phi\n\n        # Reshape the tensor to (m, Nv, r) for faster sampling\n        reshaped_probabilities = tf.transpose(probabilities, perm=[1, 2, 0])\n\n        return reshaped_probabilities\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Exponential Calculation**: We first calculate the exponential of `phi` using `tf.exp(phi)`. This is a common step in the softmax function to ensure all values are positive.\n\n2. **Normalization**: We sum the exponentials over the possible ratings axis (axis 0) to normalize the probabilities. This is done using `tf.reduce_sum(exp_phi, axis=0, keepdims=True)`.\n\n3. **Softmax Calculation**: The probabilities are calculated by dividing the exponentials by their sum, which is the essence of the softmax function.\n\n4. **Reshape for Sampling**: Finally, we reshape the tensor to `(m, Nv, r)` using `tf.transpose` to allow for faster sampling when used in the multinomial function. This involves permuting the dimensions of the tensor.\n\nThis function will return a tensor of probabilities that can be used to sample visible units in the RBM model.",
