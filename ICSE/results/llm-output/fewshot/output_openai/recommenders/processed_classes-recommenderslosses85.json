    "result": "To implement the `losses` function for the `RBM` class that calculates the contrastive divergence, you need to compute the free energy for both the data (`vv`) and the model's visible units after Gibbs sampling (`self.v_k`). The contrastive divergence is the difference between these two free energy values. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\nclass RBM:\n    def __init__(self, possible_ratings, visible_units, hidden_units=500, keep_prob=0.7, init_stdv=0.1, learning_rate=0.004, minibatch_size=100, training_epoch=20, display_epoch=10, sampling_protocol=[50, 70, 80, 90, 100], debug=False, with_metrics=False, seed=42):\n        self.v_k = None  # visible units at step k after Gibbs sampling\n        # Initialize other parameters as needed\n        pass\n\n    def free_energy(self, x):\n        # Outputs the free energy of the visible units given the hidden units\n        # This is a placeholder implementation. You need to replace it with the actual computation.\n        # Typically, free energy is computed as: F(v) = -v*b - sum(log(1 + exp(W*v + c)))\n        # where v is the visible layer, b is the visible bias, W is the weight matrix, and c is the hidden bias.\n        pass\n\n    def losses(self, vv):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the contrastive divergence loss.\n\n        Args:\n            vv (Tensor): The visible units (data) tensor.\n\n        Returns:\n            Tensor: The contrastive divergence loss.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Calculate the free energy of the data\n        free_energy_data = self.free_energy(vv)\n\n        # Calculate the free energy of the model's visible units after Gibbs sampling\n        free_energy_model = self.free_energy(self.v_k)\n\n        # Contrastive divergence is the difference between the two free energies\n        contrastive_divergence = free_energy_data - free_energy_model\n\n        return contrastive_divergence\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`free_energy` Method**: This method should compute the free energy of the visible units. The actual implementation will depend on the specific architecture and parameters of your RBM. Typically, the free energy is calculated using the formula:\n  \\[\n  F(v) = -v \\cdot b - \\sum \\log(1 + \\exp(W \\cdot v + c))\n  \\]\n  where \\(v\\) is the visible layer, \\(b\\) is the visible bias, \\(W\\) is the weight matrix, and \\(c\\) is the hidden bias.\n\n- **`losses` Method**: This method calculates the contrastive divergence by computing the difference between the free energy of the data (`vv`) and the free energy of the model's visible units after Gibbs sampling (`self.v_k`).\n\nMake sure to implement the `free_energy` method according to your RBM's architecture and parameters.",
