    "result": "To implement the `_normalize` method for the `RCF` class that performs ZCA whitening on a set of input patches, you can follow these steps. The method will normalize the patches by removing the mean, normalizing the patches to have unit norms, and then applying ZCA whitening. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nclass RCF:\n    def __init__(self, in_channels: int = 4, features: int = 16, kernel_size: int = 3, bias: float = -1.0, seed: int | None = None, mode: str = 'gaussian', dataset: NonGeoDataset | None = None):\n        self.weights = ...\n        self.biases = ...\n        pass\n\n    def _normalize(self, patches: np.typing.NDArray[np.float32], min_divisor: float = 1e-8, zca_bias: float = 0.001) -> np.typing.NDArray[np.float32]:\n        # Flatten the patches to (N, C*H*W)\n        N, C, H, W = patches.shape\n        flat_patches = patches.reshape(N, -1)\n\n        # Step 1: Remove the mean\n        mean = np.mean(flat_patches, axis=0)\n        centered_patches = flat_patches - mean\n\n        # Step 2: Normalize to have unit norms\n        norms = np.linalg.norm(centered_patches, axis=1, keepdims=True)\n        norms = np.maximum(norms, min_divisor)  # Prevent division by zero\n        normalized_patches = centered_patches / norms\n\n        # Step 3: Compute the covariance matrix\n        covariance_matrix = np.cov(normalized_patches, rowvar=False)\n\n        # Step 4: Perform ZCA whitening\n        U, S, V = np.linalg.svd(covariance_matrix)\n        S_inv_sqrt = np.diag(1.0 / np.sqrt(S + zca_bias))\n        zca_matrix = U @ S_inv_sqrt @ U.T\n        whitened_patches = normalized_patches @ zca_matrix\n\n        # Reshape back to the original shape\n        whitened_patches = whitened_patches.reshape(N, C, H, W)\n\n        return whitened_patches\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Flattening**: The patches are reshaped to a 2D array where each patch is a row. This makes it easier to perform operations like mean subtraction and covariance computation.\n\n2. **Mean Removal**: The mean of each feature (across all patches) is subtracted to center the data.\n\n3. **Normalization**: Each patch is normalized to have a unit norm. This step ensures that the patches have consistent scale.\n\n4. **Covariance Matrix**: The covariance matrix of the normalized patches is computed.\n\n5. **ZCA Whitening**: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to compute the whitening matrix. A small bias (`zca_bias`) is added to the eigenvalues to ensure numerical stability.\n\n6. **Reshaping**: The whitened patches are reshaped back to their original dimensions.\n\nThis implementation follows the typical steps for ZCA whitening and includes safeguards against division by zero. Adjust the `min_divisor` and `zca_bias` parameters as needed for your specific use case.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `_normalize` for the `RCF` class that performs ZCA whitening on a set of input patches. The method should normalize the patches by removing the mean, normalizing the patches to have unit norms, and then applying ZCA whitening. The method should take as input a NumPy array `patches` of shape `(N, C, H, W)` and return a normalized NumPy array of the same shape. Additional parameters should include `min_divisor` to prevent division by zero and `zca_bias` to add a small bias during whitening. The method should follow the ZCA whitening steps as specified in the `mosaiks-paper` repository.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass RCF:\n    def __init__(self, in_channels: int = 4, features: int = 16, kernel_size: int = 3, bias: float = -1.0, seed: int | None = None, mode: str = 'gaussian', dataset: NonGeoDataset | None = None):\n        self.weights = ...\n        self.biases = ...\n        pass\n\n    def _normalize(self, patches: np.typing.NDArray[np.float32], min_divisor: float = 1e-8, zca_bias: float = 0.001) -> np.typing.NDArray[np.float32]:\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
