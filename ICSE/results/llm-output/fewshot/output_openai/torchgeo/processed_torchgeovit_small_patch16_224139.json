    "result": "To create a Python function that generates a Vision Transformer (ViT) model with a small patch size of 16, you can use the `timm` library, which provides a wide range of pre-trained models, including Vision Transformers. Below is an example of how you might implement such a function:\n\n```python\nimport timm\nfrom timm.models.vision_transformer import VisionTransformer\n\ndef vit_small_patch16_224(pretrained_weights: str = None, **kwargs) -> VisionTransformer:\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a Vision Transformer (ViT) model with small patch size 16.\n\n    Args:\n        pretrained_weights (str, optional): Path to pre-trained model weights. Defaults to None.\n        **kwargs: Additional arguments to pass to the ViT model constructor.\n\n    Returns:\n        VisionTransformer: A Vision Transformer model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a ViT small 16 model using the timm library\n    model = timm.create_model('vit_small_patch16_224', pretrained=False, **kwargs)\n\n    # Load pre-trained weights if provided\n    if pretrained_weights:\n        state_dict = torch.load(pretrained_weights, map_location='cpu')\n        model.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=False)\n\n    return model\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Importing Libraries**: The function imports the necessary components from the `timm` library, which is used to create and manage the Vision Transformer models.\n\n2. **Function Definition**: The function `vit_small_patch16_224` is defined to create a ViT model with a small patch size of 16. It accepts an optional argument `pretrained_weights` for loading pre-trained weights and `**kwargs` for any additional arguments that might be needed for the model.\n\n3. **Model Creation**: The function uses `timm.create_model` to instantiate a ViT model with the specified configuration (`vit_small_patch16_224`). The `pretrained` parameter is set to `False` to avoid loading any default pre-trained weights.\n\n4. **Loading Pre-trained Weights**: If a path to pre-trained weights is provided, the function loads these weights into the model using `torch.load` and `model.load_state_dict`.\n\n5. **Return**: The function returns the configured Vision Transformer model.\n\nThis function provides a flexible way to create a ViT model with the option to load custom pre-trained weights, making it suitable for various applications in computer vision tasks.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called vit_small_patch16_224 that creates a Vision Transformer (ViT) model with small patch size 16. The function takes in optional pre-trained model weights, additional arguments, and keyword arguments. If weights are provided, the function adjusts the input channels based on the weights. The function then creates a ViT small 16 model using the timm library, loads the pre-trained weights if available, and returns the model.",
