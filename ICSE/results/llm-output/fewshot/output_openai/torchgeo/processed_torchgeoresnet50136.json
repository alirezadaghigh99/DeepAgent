    "result": "To create a Python function that generates a ResNet-50 model using the `timm` library, you can follow the structure and style of the examples provided. Here's how you can implement the `resnet50` function:\n\n```python\nimport timm\nimport torch\n\ndef resnet50(weights: Optional[str] = None, *args, **kwargs) -> torch.nn.Module:\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a ResNet-50 model using the timm library.\n\n    Args:\n        weights (str, optional): Path to the pre-trained model weights. Defaults to None.\n        *args: Additional arguments for the model creation.\n        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments for the model creation.\n\n    Returns:\n        model (torch.nn.Module): The ResNet-50 model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create the ResNet-50 model\n    model = timm.create_model('resnet50', pretrained=False, *args, **kwargs)\n\n    if weights is not None:\n        # Load the state dictionary from the provided weights\n        state_dict = torch.load(weights, map_location='cpu')\n        \n        # Ensure that certain keys are present in the state dictionary\n        required_keys = ['conv1.weight', 'fc.weight', 'fc.bias']\n        for key in required_keys:\n            if key not in state_dict:\n                raise ValueError(f\"Key '{key}' not found in the provided weights.\")\n        \n        # Load the state dictionary into the model\n        model.load_state_dict(state_dict)\n\n    return model\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Imports**: The function imports necessary modules, including `timm` for model creation and `torch` for handling model weights.\n\n2. **Function Definition**: The `resnet50` function is defined to accept optional weights, additional arguments (`*args`), and keyword arguments (`**kwargs`).\n\n3. **Model Creation**: The function uses `timm.create_model` to create a ResNet-50 model. The `pretrained` parameter is set to `False` initially, but you can modify this based on your needs.\n\n4. **Weights Loading**: If weights are provided, the function loads the state dictionary from the specified path. It checks for the presence of essential keys in the state dictionary to ensure compatibility.\n\n5. **Return**: The function returns the ResNet-50 model, either with or without the loaded weights.\n\nThis function provides flexibility in creating a ResNet-50 model with or without pre-trained weights, and it allows for additional customization through arguments and keyword arguments.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called resnet50 that creates a ResNet-50 model. The function takes in optional pre-trained model weights, additional arguments, and keyword arguments. If weights are provided, the function sets the input channels based on the weights. The function then creates a ResNet-50 model using the timm library. If weights are provided, the function loads the state dictionary from the weights and ensures that certain keys are present. The function returns the ResNet-50 model.",
