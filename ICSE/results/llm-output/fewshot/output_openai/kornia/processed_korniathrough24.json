    "result": "To create the `through` method within the `ParametrizedLine` class, you need to define a class that can represent a parameterized line and then implement the method to calculate the direction vector between two points, `p0` and `p1`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\nclass ParametrizedLine:\n    def __init__(self, point: torch.Tensor, direction: torch.Tensor):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize a ParametrizedLine with a point and a direction vector.\n\n        Args:\n            point (Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, D) representing a point on the line.\n            direction (Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, D) representing the direction of the line.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.point = point\n        self.direction = direction\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def through(p0: torch.Tensor, p1: torch.Tensor) -> 'ParametrizedLine':\n        \"\"\"\n        Create a ParametrizedLine through two points, p0 and p1.\n\n        Args:\n            p0 (Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, D) representing the starting point.\n            p1 (Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, D) representing the ending point.\n\n        Returns:\n            ParametrizedLine: An instance of ParametrizedLine representing the line through p0 and p1.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Calculate the direction vector from p0 to p1\n        direction = p1 - p0\n        \n        # Normalize the direction vector\n        norm = torch.norm(direction, dim=1, keepdim=True)\n        normalized_direction = direction / norm\n\n        # Return an instance of ParametrizedLine\n        return ParametrizedLine(point=p0, direction=normalized_direction)\n\n# Example usage:\n# p0 and p1 are tensors of shape (B, D)\np0 = torch.tensor([[0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0]])\np1 = torch.tensor([[1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 2.0]])\n\nline = ParametrizedLine.through(p0, p1)\nprint(\"Point on the line:\", line.point)\nprint(\"Direction of the line:\", line.direction)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Class Definition**: The `ParametrizedLine` class is defined with an `__init__` method that takes a point and a direction vector as inputs.\n- **Static Method `through`**: This method calculates the direction vector from `p0` to `p1` and normalizes it. It then returns an instance of `ParametrizedLine`.\n- **Normalization**: The direction vector is normalized by dividing it by its norm, ensuring that the direction vector has a unit length.\n- **Usage**: The example usage demonstrates how to create a parameterized line between two points using the `through` method.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python method `through` within the `ParametrizedLine` class that constructs a parametrized line between two points, `p0` and `p1`. Both `p0` and `p1` are tensors of shape `(B, D)`, where `B` is the batch size and `D` is the dimensionality of the points. The method should return an instance of `ParametrizedLine` by calculating the direction vector from `p0` to `p1` and normalizing it. This method is useful in geometry-related tasks, such as computer graphics or physics simulations, where representing and working with lines in a parameterized form is necessary.",
