    "result": "To implement the `undistort_points_kannala_brandt` function using the Gauss-Newton optimization algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Kannala-Brandt Model**: This model is used for fisheye lens distortion and involves a set of parameters that describe the distortion.\n\n2. **Set Up the Optimization Problem**: We need to iteratively adjust the undistorted points to minimize the difference between the distorted points and the re-projected points using the distortion model.\n\n3. **Implement the Gauss-Newton Algorithm**: This involves computing the Jacobian matrix and updating the undistorted points iteratively.\n\nHere's a Python implementation of the function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef undistort_points_kannala_brandt(distorted_points_in_camera: torch.Tensor, params: torch.Tensor, max_iterations: int = 10, tolerance: float = 1e-6) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Undistorts points from the camera frame into the canonical z=1 plane using the Kannala-Brandt model.\n\n    Args:\n        distorted_points_in_camera (Tensor): Tensor of shape (..., 2) representing the distorted points.\n        params (Tensor): Tensor of shape (..., 8) representing the distortion parameters.\n        max_iterations (int): Maximum number of iterations for the Gauss-Newton optimization.\n        tolerance (float): Tolerance for convergence.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor: Undistorted points with shape (..., 2).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize undistorted points as the distorted points\n    undistorted_points = distorted_points_in_camera.clone()\n\n    for _ in range(max_iterations):\n        # Compute the radial distance\n        r = torch.norm(undistorted_points, dim=-1, keepdim=True)\n\n        # Compute the distortion using the Kannala-Brandt model\n        theta = torch.atan(r)\n        theta_d = (params[..., 0] * theta +\n                   params[..., 1] * theta**3 +\n                   params[..., 2] * theta**5 +\n                   params[..., 3] * theta**7)\n\n        # Compute the Jacobian matrix\n        J = torch.zeros_like(undistorted_points)\n        J[..., 0] = (undistorted_points[..., 0] / r) * (theta_d / r)\n        J[..., 1] = (undistorted_points[..., 1] / r) * (theta_d / r)\n\n        # Compute the error\n        distorted_estimate = undistorted_points * (theta_d / r)\n        error = distorted_points_in_camera - distorted_estimate\n\n        # Update the undistorted points using the Gauss-Newton step\n        delta = torch.linalg.solve(J.transpose(-1, -2) @ J, J.transpose(-1, -2) @ error.unsqueeze(-1)).squeeze(-1)\n        undistorted_points += delta\n\n        # Check for convergence\n        if torch.max(torch.abs(delta)) < tolerance:\n            break\n\n    return undistorted_points\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Initialization**: The undistorted points are initialized as the distorted points.\n- **Radial Distance and Distortion**: The radial distance `r` and the distorted angle `theta_d` are computed using the Kannala-Brandt model.\n- **Jacobian Matrix**: The Jacobian matrix `J` is computed to facilitate the Gauss-Newton update.\n- **Error and Update**: The error between the estimated distorted points and the actual distorted points is computed, and the undistorted points are updated using the Gauss-Newton step.\n- **Convergence Check**: The loop terminates if the maximum change in the undistorted points is below a specified tolerance.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input tensors are compatible in terms of broadcasting and that the parameters are correctly specified for the Kannala-Brandt model. Adjustments may be needed based on specific use cases or additional constraints.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called undistort_points_kannala_brandt that undistorts one or more points from the camera frame into the canonical z=1 plane using the Kannala-Brandt model. The function takes two input parameters: distorted_points_in_camera, a Tensor representing the points to undistort with shape (..., 2), and params, a Tensor representing the parameters of the Kannala-Brandt distortion model with shape (..., 8). The function returns a Tensor representing the undistorted points with shape (..., 2). The function implements the Gauss-Newton optimization algorithm to iteratively undistort the points.",
