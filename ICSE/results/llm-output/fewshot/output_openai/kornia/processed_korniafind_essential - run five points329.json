    "result": "Creating a function to compute the essential matrix using Nister's 5-point algorithm involves several steps, including validating input shapes, constructing a linear system, applying weights, and solving for the essential matrix. Below is a Python function that outlines these steps using PyTorch for tensor operations:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Optional\n\ndef run_5point(points1: torch.Tensor, points2: torch.Tensor, weights: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the essential matrix using Nister's 5-point algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        points1 (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape (B, N, 2) containing calibrated points from the first image.\n        points2 (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape (B, N, 2) containing calibrated points from the second image.\n        weights (torch.Tensor, optional): Tensor of shape (B, N) containing weights for each point pair. Defaults to None.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: Tensor of shape (B, 3, 3) containing the essential matrix for each batch.\n    \"\"\"\n    B, N, _ = points1.shape\n\n    if points1.shape != points2.shape:\n        raise ValueError(\"points1 and points2 must have the same shape.\")\n    if N < 5:\n        raise ValueError(\"At least 5 point correspondences are required.\")\n\n    # Construct the linear system\n    A = torch.zeros((B, N, 9), dtype=points1.dtype, device=points1.device)\n    A[:, :, 0] = points1[:, :, 0] * points2[:, :, 0]\n    A[:, :, 1] = points1[:, :, 0] * points2[:, :, 1]\n    A[:, :, 2] = points1[:, :, 0]\n    A[:, :, 3] = points1[:, :, 1] * points2[:, :, 0]\n    A[:, :, 4] = points1[:, :, 1] * points2[:, :, 1]\n    A[:, :, 5] = points1[:, :, 1]\n    A[:, :, 6] = points2[:, :, 0]\n    A[:, :, 7] = points2[:, :, 1]\n    A[:, :, 8] = 1\n\n    # Apply weights if provided\n    if weights is not None:\n        if weights.shape != (B, N):\n            raise ValueError(\"weights must have shape (B, N).\")\n        A *= weights.unsqueeze(-1)\n\n    # Solve for the essential matrix using SVD\n    U, S, Vt = torch.svd(A)\n    E = Vt[:, -1].view(B, 3, 3)\n\n    # Enforce the rank-2 constraint on the essential matrix\n    U, S, Vt = torch.svd(E)\n    S = torch.diag_embed(torch.tensor([1, 1, 0], dtype=S.dtype, device=S.device))\n    E = U @ S @ Vt\n\n    return E\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function checks that `points1` and `points2` have the same shape and that there are at least 5 point correspondences.\n\n2. **Linear System Construction**: The matrix `A` is constructed using the point correspondences. Each row of `A` corresponds to a point pair and is constructed based on the epipolar constraint.\n\n3. **Weights Application**: If weights are provided, they are applied to the matrix `A`.\n\n4. **Solving for the Essential Matrix**: The essential matrix is computed using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The last column of `Vt` (from SVD of `A`) gives the solution to the homogeneous system.\n\n5. **Rank-2 Constraint**: The essential matrix is enforced to have rank 2 by setting the smallest singular value to zero.\n\nThis function assumes that the input points are already calibrated (i.e., they are in normalized camera coordinates).",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called run_5point that computes the essential matrix using Nister's 5-point algorithm. The function should take two tensors of calibrated points from two images and an optional weights tensor. It should validate the input shapes, construct a linear system, apply weights if provided, and solve for the essential matrix, returning a (B, 3, 3) tensor for each batch",
