    "result": "To write the `_compute_luts` function, we need to compute lookup tables (LUTs) for a batched set of tiles. The function will take in a batch of image tiles and compute a LUT for each tile based on the specified number of bins and a clipping threshold for contrast limiting. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef _compute_luts(tiles_x_im, num_bins=256, clip=0, diff=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute LUTs for a batched set of tiles.\n\n    Args:\n        tiles_x_im: set of tiles per image to apply the LUT. Shape (B, GH, GW, C, TH, TW)\n        num_bins: number of bins. Default: 256\n        clip: threshold value for contrast limiting. If it is 0, then the clipping is disabled.\n        diff: denote if the differentiable histogram will be used. Default: False\n\n    Returns:\n        LUT for each tile. Shape (B, GH, GW, C, 256)\n    \"\"\"\n    B, GH, GW, C, TH, TW = tiles_x_im.shape\n    luts = np.zeros((B, GH, GW, C, num_bins), dtype=np.float32)\n\n    for b in range(B):\n        for gh in range(GH):\n            for gw in range(GW):\n                for c in range(C):\n                    tile = tiles_x_im[b, gh, gw, c]\n                    hist, _ = np.histogram(tile, bins=num_bins, range=(0, num_bins-1))\n                    \n                    if clip > 0:\n                        excess = np.maximum(hist - clip, 0)\n                        hist = np.minimum(hist, clip)\n                        hist += excess.sum() // num_bins\n\n                    cdf = hist.cumsum()\n                    cdf_min = cdf.min()\n                    cdf_max = cdf.max()\n                    \n                    if cdf_max > cdf_min:\n                        lut = (cdf - cdf_min) * (num_bins - 1) / (cdf_max - cdf_min)\n                    else:\n                        lut = np.zeros_like(cdf)\n\n                    luts[b, gh, gw, c] = lut\n\n    return luts\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Parameters:**\n  - `tiles_x_im`: A numpy array of shape `(B, GH, GW, C, TH, TW)` representing a batch of image tiles.\n  - `num_bins`: The number of bins for the histogram. Default is 256.\n  - `clip`: A threshold for contrast limiting. If set to 0, clipping is disabled.\n  - `diff`: A boolean indicating if a differentiable histogram should be used. This implementation does not handle differentiable histograms, as it requires a different approach (e.g., using PyTorch for automatic differentiation).\n\n- **Output:**\n  - The function returns a numpy array of shape `(B, GH, GW, C, 256)` containing the LUT for each tile.\n\n- **Implementation Details:**\n  - The function iterates over each tile in the batch and computes a histogram.\n  - If `clip` is greater than 0, it applies contrast limiting by clipping the histogram and redistributing the excess.\n  - It computes the cumulative distribution function (CDF) from the histogram and normalizes it to create the LUT.\n  - The LUT is stored in the `luts` array, which is returned at the end.",
