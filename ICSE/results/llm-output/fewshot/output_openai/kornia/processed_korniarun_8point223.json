    "result": "To implement the `run_8point` function for computing the fundamental matrix using the Direct Linear Transform (DLT) formulation with a Weighted Least Squares solution, you can follow these steps. This function will take in two sets of corresponding points from two images and weights for each correspondence, and it will return the fundamental matrix for each batch.\n\nHere's a possible implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef run_8point(points1: torch.Tensor, points2: torch.Tensor, weights: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the fundamental matrix using the DLT formulation with Weighted Least Squares.\n\n    Args:\n        points1: A set of points in the first image with a tensor shape (B, N, 2), N>=8.\n        points2: A set of points in the second image with a tensor shape (B, N, 2), N>=8.\n        weights: Tensor containing the weights per point correspondence with a shape of (B, N).\n\n    Returns:\n        The computed fundamental matrix with shape (B, 3, 3).\n    \"\"\"\n    B, N, _ = points1.shape\n\n    # Ensure the points are in homogeneous coordinates\n    ones = torch.ones((B, N, 1), dtype=points1.dtype, device=points1.device)\n    points1_h = torch.cat([points1, ones], dim=-1)\n    points2_h = torch.cat([points2, ones], dim=-1)\n\n    # Construct the design matrix A\n    A = torch.zeros((B, N, 9), dtype=points1.dtype, device=points1.device)\n    A[:, :, 0] = points2_h[:, :, 0] * points1_h[:, :, 0]\n    A[:, :, 1] = points2_h[:, :, 0] * points1_h[:, :, 1]\n    A[:, :, 2] = points2_h[:, :, 0]\n    A[:, :, 3] = points2_h[:, :, 1] * points1_h[:, :, 0]\n    A[:, :, 4] = points2_h[:, :, 1] * points1_h[:, :, 1]\n    A[:, :, 5] = points2_h[:, :, 1]\n    A[:, :, 6] = points1_h[:, :, 0]\n    A[:, :, 7] = points1_h[:, :, 1]\n    A[:, :, 8] = 1\n\n    # Apply weights\n    W = weights.unsqueeze(-1)  # Shape (B, N, 1)\n    A_weighted = A * W\n\n    # Solve the weighted least squares problem using SVD\n    U, S, Vt = torch.linalg.svd(A_weighted)\n    F = Vt[:, -1].reshape(B, 3, 3)\n\n    # Enforce the rank-2 constraint on F\n    U_f, S_f, Vt_f = torch.linalg.svd(F)\n    S_f[:, -1] = 0  # Set the smallest singular value to zero\n    F_rank2 = U_f @ torch.diag_embed(S_f) @ Vt_f\n\n    return F_rank2\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Homogeneous Coordinates**: The input points are converted to homogeneous coordinates by appending a column of ones.\n- **Design Matrix Construction**: The design matrix \\( A \\) is constructed using the point correspondences.\n- **Weighted Least Squares**: The weights are applied to the design matrix, and the weighted least squares problem is solved using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).\n- **Rank-2 Constraint**: The fundamental matrix is enforced to be rank-2 by setting the smallest singular value to zero.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input tensors are on the same device and have compatible data types. Adjustments may be needed based on specific requirements or constraints.",
