    "result": "To create the `rotate_laf` function, we need to apply a rotation transformation to each Local Affine Frame (LAF) in the input tensor. The LAF is represented by a tensor of shape `(B, N, 2, 3)`, where `B` is the batch size, `N` is the number of LAFs, and each LAF is a 2x3 matrix. The rotation angles are provided in degrees in a tensor of shape `(B, N, 1)`. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef rotate_laf(LAF: torch.Tensor, angles_degrees: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Rotate a Local Affine Frame (LAF) by specified angles.\n\n    Args:\n        LAF (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape (B, N, 2, 3) representing the LAFs.\n        angles_degrees (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape (B, N, 1) representing rotation angles in degrees.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: Rotated LAF with the same shape as input.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the input LAF is not of shape (B, N, 2, 3).\n    \"\"\"\n    if LAF.ndim != 4 or LAF.shape[2:] != (2, 3):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input LAF must be of shape (B, N, 2, 3)\")\n\n    # Convert angles from degrees to radians\n    angles_radians = torch.deg2rad(angles_degrees.squeeze(-1))\n\n    # Compute the rotation matrices\n    cos_angles = torch.cos(angles_radians)\n    sin_angles = torch.sin(angles_radians)\n\n    rotation_matrices = torch.stack([\n        torch.stack([cos_angles, -sin_angles], dim=-1),\n        torch.stack([sin_angles, cos_angles], dim=-1)\n    ], dim=-2)\n\n    # Apply the rotation to the LAF\n    rotated_LAF = torch.matmul(rotation_matrices, LAF[..., :2])\n\n    # Concatenate the translation part back\n    rotated_LAF = torch.cat([rotated_LAF, LAF[..., 2:]], dim=-1)\n\n    return rotated_LAF\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the input `LAF` tensor has the correct shape `(B, N, 2, 3)`. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Angle Conversion**: The rotation angles are converted from degrees to radians using `torch.deg2rad`.\n\n3. **Rotation Matrix Construction**: For each angle, a 2x2 rotation matrix is constructed using the cosine and sine of the angle.\n\n4. **Rotation Application**: The rotation matrix is applied to the first two columns of each LAF (which represent the linear transformation part) using matrix multiplication.\n\n5. **Translation Preservation**: The last column of each LAF, which represents translation, is concatenated back to the rotated linear transformation part to form the final rotated LAF.\n\nThis function will return the rotated LAFs with the same shape as the input.",
    "prompt": "Create a function `rotate_laf` that applies an additional rotation to a Local Affine Frame (LAF). The function takes in a tensor `LAF` of shape `(B, N, 2, 3)` and a tensor `angles_degrees` of shape `(B, N, 1)` representing rotation angles in degrees. It returns the rotated LAF with the same shape. The function raises an error if the input LAF is not properly structured.",
