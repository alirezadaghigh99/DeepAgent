It also checks that the matrix has at least 2x2 dimensions.\n  \n- **Normalization**: The function normalizes the matrix by dividing all elements by the value in the last row and column, adding a small `eps` value to avoid division by zero.\n\n- **Setting the Last Element**: After normalization, the function explicitly sets the last element of the matrix to 1.0 to ensure the transformation matrix is properly normalized.\n\n- **Return**: The function returns the normalized transformation matrix with the same shape as the input.",
    "prompt": "---\n\nCreate a Python function `normalize_transformation` that:\n\n- Accepts two parameters:\n  - `M`: A tensor representing a transformation matrix of any shape with at least 2x2 dimensions.\n  - `eps`: A small float value (default is `1e-8`) used to avoid numerical instabilities during backpropagation.\n- The function normalizes the input transformation matrix `M` so that the value in the last row and column is set to one.\n- Returns the normalized transformation matrix with the same shape as the input.\n\nErrors:\n- Raises an `AssertionError` if the input matrix `M` has fewer than 2 dimensions.",
