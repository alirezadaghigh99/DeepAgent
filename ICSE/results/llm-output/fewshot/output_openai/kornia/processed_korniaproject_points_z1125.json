    "result": "To create the `project_points_z1` function, we need to perform perspective division on the input points. This involves dividing the x and y coordinates by the z coordinate to project the points onto the z=1 plane. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef project_points_z1(points_in_camera: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Projects points from the camera frame into the canonical z=1 plane through perspective division.\n\n    Args:\n        points_in_camera (Tensor): A tensor of shape (..., 3) representing the points to project.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor: A tensor of shape (..., 2) representing the projected points.\n    \"\"\"\n    if points_in_camera.shape[-1] != 3:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input tensor must have shape (..., 3)\")\n\n    # Ensure the points are in front of the camera\n    if torch.any(points_in_camera[..., 2] <= 0):\n        raise ValueError(\"All points must have z > 0 to be in front of the camera\")\n\n    # Perform perspective division\n    x = points_in_camera[..., 0] / points_in_camera[..., 2]\n    y = points_in_camera[..., 1] / points_in_camera[..., 2]\n\n    # Stack the results to get the final projected points\n    projected_points = torch.stack((x, y), dim=-1)\n\n    return projected_points\n\n# Example usage\npoints = torch.tensor([1., 2., 3.])\nprojected_points = project_points_z1(points)\nprint(projected_points)  # Output: tensor([0.3333, 0.6667])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the input tensor has the correct shape (..., 3). It also checks if all z-values are greater than zero to ensure the points are in front of the camera.\n- **Perspective Division**: The x and y coordinates are divided by the z coordinate to project the points onto the z=1 plane.\n- **Output**: The function returns a tensor with the projected points, having shape (..., 2).\n\nThis function will correctly project points from the camera frame to the canonical z=1 plane, assuming all points are in front of the camera.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called project_points_z1 that projects one or more points from the camera frame into the canonical z=1 plane through perspective division. The input is a tensor called points_in_camera with shape (..., 3) representing the points to project. The function has a precondition that the points are in front of the camera (z > 0). If this is not the case, the points will be projected to the canonical plane, but the resulting points will be behind the camera and may cause numerical issues for z == 0. The output is a tensor representing the projected points with shape (..., 2). An example usage of the function is as follows:\n\n```python\npoints = torch.tensor([1., 2., 3.])\nproject_points_z1(points)\n```\n\nThis will return a tensor with values [0.3333, 0.6667].",
