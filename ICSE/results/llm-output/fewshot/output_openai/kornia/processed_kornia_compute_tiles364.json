    "result": "To implement the `_compute_tiles` function, we need to handle several tasks:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: Ensure the grid size is valid and does not exceed the image dimensions after padding.\n2. **Padding**: If the grid size does not perfectly fit the image dimensions, pad the images appropriately.\n3. **Tile Extraction**: Extract tiles from the padded images based on the grid size.\n4. **Output**: Return the tiles and the padded images.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef _compute_tiles(images: torch.Tensor, grid_size: tuple, even_tile_size: bool = False) -> tuple:\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute tiles from a batch of 2D images.\n\n    Args:\n        images (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (B, C, H, W) representing the batch of images.\n        grid_size (tuple): A tuple (GH, GW) representing the number of tiles in height and width.\n        even_tile_size (bool): If True, ensures the tiles have even dimensions.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing two tensors:\n            - tiles: A tensor of shape (B, GH, GW, C, TH, TW) with the computed tiles.\n            - padded_images: A tensor of the padded batch of images.\n    \"\"\"\n    B, C, H, W = images.shape\n    GH, GW = grid_size\n\n    # Calculate the tile size\n    tile_height = H // GH\n    tile_width = W // GW\n\n    # Adjust tile size to be even if required\n    if even_tile_size:\n        tile_height += tile_height % 2\n        tile_width += tile_width % 2\n\n    # Calculate the required padding\n    pad_height = (tile_height * GH) - H\n    pad_width = (tile_width * GW) - W\n\n    # Check if grid size exceeds image dimensions after padding\n    if pad_height < 0 or pad_width < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Grid size exceeds image dimensions after padding.\")\n\n    # Pad the images\n    padded_images = F.pad(images, (0, pad_width, 0, pad_height))\n\n    # Extract tiles\n    tiles = padded_images.unfold(2, tile_height, tile_height).unfold(3, tile_width, tile_width)\n    tiles = tiles.permute(0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5)  # Rearrange to (B, GH, GW, C, TH, TW)\n\n    return tiles, padded_images\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Input Validation**: We check if the grid size exceeds the image dimensions after padding. If so, a `ValueError` is raised.\n- **Padding**: We calculate the necessary padding to ensure the grid size fits the image dimensions. The `F.pad` function is used to pad the images.\n- **Tile Extraction**: The `unfold` method is used to extract tiles from the padded images. The `unfold` method creates sliding windows over the specified dimensions.\n- **Output**: The function returns a tuple containing the tiles and the padded images. The tiles are rearranged to have the shape `(B, GH, GW, C, TH, TW)`.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the tiles are extracted correctly and that the images are padded appropriately if needed.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function _compute_tiles that takes a batch of 2D images as a PyTorch tensor, a grid size tuple representing the number of tiles to crop in each direction, and an optional boolean even_tile_size to ensure the tiles have even dimensions. The function should return a tuple containing two tensors: one with the computed tiles and another with the padded batch of images. The tile tensor should have the shape (B, GH, GW, C, TH, TW), where B is the batch size. Ensure that the image is padded appropriately if the grid size does not perfectly fit the image dimensions. Raise a ValueError if the grid size exceeds the image dimensions after padding.",
