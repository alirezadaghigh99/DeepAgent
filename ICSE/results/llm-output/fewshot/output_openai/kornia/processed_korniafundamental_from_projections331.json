    "result": "To create a Python function named `fundamental_from_projections` that calculates the fundamental matrix from two projection matrices (`P1` and `P2`), we need to ensure that the input matrices have the correct shape and data type. The function will compute the fundamental matrix using determinants of specific submatrices derived from the input projections. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef fundamental_from_projections(P1: torch.Tensor, P2: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the fundamental matrix from two projection matrices.\n\n    Args:\n        P1 (Tensor): First projection matrix of shape (*, 3, 4).\n        P2 (Tensor): Second projection matrix of shape (*, 3, 4).\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor: Fundamental matrix of shape (*, 3, 3).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure the input matrices have the correct shape\n    assert P1.shape[-2:] == (3, 4), \"P1 must have shape (*, 3, 4)\"\n    assert P2.shape[-2:] == (3, 4), \"P2 must have shape (*, 3, 4)\"\n    assert P1.shape[:-2] == P2.shape[:-2], \"P1 and P2 must have matching batch dimensions\"\n\n    # Convert inputs to float32 if they are not float32 or float64\n    if P1.dtype not in [torch.float32, torch.float64]:\n        P1 = P1.to(torch.float32)\n    if P2.dtype not in [torch.float32, torch.float64]:\n        P2 = P2.to(torch.float32)\n\n    # Compute the fundamental matrix\n    # The fundamental matrix F can be computed using the cross product of the epipoles\n    # and the projection matrices. Here, we use determinants of submatrices.\n    F = torch.zeros(*P1.shape[:-2], 3, 3, dtype=P1.dtype, device=P1.device)\n\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            # Create submatrices by removing the i-th row from P1 and the j-th row from P2\n            P1_sub = torch.cat([P1[..., :i, :], P1[..., i+1:, :]], dim=-2)\n            P2_sub = torch.cat([P2[..., :j, :], P2[..., j+1:, :]], dim=-2)\n\n            # Compute the determinant of the submatrices\n            F[..., i, j] = torch.det(P1_sub) * torch.det(P2_sub)\n\n    return F\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Shape and Type Checks**: The function first checks that both `P1` and `P2` have the shape `(*, 3, 4)` and matching batch dimensions. It also ensures that the data type is either `float32` or `float64`, converting if necessary.\n- **Fundamental Matrix Calculation**: The fundamental matrix is calculated using determinants of submatrices derived from the input projection matrices. This involves removing specific rows from `P1` and `P2` to form submatrices, computing their determinants, and using these to fill the fundamental matrix.\n- **Output**: The function returns a tensor of shape `(*, 3, 3)` representing the fundamental matrix.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function named `fundamental_from_projections` that calculates the fundamental matrix from two projection matrices (`P1` and `P2`). The function should ensure that both projection matrices have the correct shape of `(*, 3, 4)` and matching batch dimensions, raising an `AssertionError` if these conditions are not met. The function computes the fundamental matrix using the determinants of specific submatrices derived from the input projections and returns a tensor of shape `(*, 3, 3)`. The function should handle different data types, converting the inputs to `torch.float32` if they are not already in `float32` or `float64`.",
