    "result": "To implement the `_load_image_to_tensor` function as described, you can use the Kornia library for image processing and PyTorch for tensor operations. Below is a Python function that meets the specified requirements:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport torch\nimport kornia as K\nfrom kornia.io import load_image\n\ndef _load_image_to_tensor(path_file: Path, device: torch.device) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Loads an image from the specified path, decodes it using Kornia, and converts it to a PyTorch tensor.\n\n    Args:\n        path_file (Path): Path object pointing to a valid image file.\n        device (torch.device): The device where the image tensor should be placed.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: Image tensor with shape (3, H, W) on the specified device.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the image format is unsupported.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the file exists\n    if not path_file.exists():\n        raise FileNotFoundError(f\"The file {path_file} does not exist.\")\n\n    # Load the image using Kornia\n    try:\n        image = load_image(str(path_file), K.io.ImageLoadType.RGB32)\n    except Exception as e:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Unsupported image format or error loading image: {e}\")\n\n    # Ensure the image is in the format (3, H, W)\n    if image.ndim != 3 or image.shape[0] != 3:\n        raise ValueError(\"The loaded image does not have the expected shape (3, H, W).\")\n\n    # Move the image tensor to the specified device\n    image = image.to(device)\n\n    return image\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Path Checking**: The function first checks if the file exists at the specified path.\n- **Image Loading**: It uses `kornia.io.load_image` to load and decode the image. The `ImageLoadType.RGB32` ensures the image is loaded as a 3-channel RGB image.\n- **Shape Validation**: It checks that the loaded image has the expected shape `(3, H, W)`.\n- **Device Transfer**: The image tensor is moved to the specified device using `.to(device)`.\n- **Error Handling**: The function raises a `FileNotFoundError` if the file does not exist and a `ValueError` if the image format is unsupported or if there is an error during loading.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function `_load_image_to_tensor` that reads an image file from the specified `path_file`, decodes it using the Kornia Rust backend, and converts it to a PyTorch tensor. The function takes two inputs: `path_file`, which is a `Path` object pointing to a valid image file, and `device`, which specifies the device (e.g., CPU or GPU) where the image tensor should be placed. The function returns the image as a tensor with shape `(3, H, W)`, where `H` is the height and `W` is the width of the image. The function handles image files with `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and other supported formats, raising an error if the image format is unsupported. It also ensures that the resulting tensor is moved to the specified device.",
