    "prompt": "Create a function `convert_points_to_homogeneous` that converts Euclidean points to homogeneous coordinates. The function takes a tensor `points` with shape `(*, N, D)` and returns a tensor of shape `(*, N, D+1)` representing the points in homogeneous space. It raises a `TypeError` if the input is not a tensor and a `ValueError` if the input tensor has fewer than two dimensions. Additionally, implement `_convert_affinematrix_to_homography_impl` to transform an affine matrix into a homography matrix, ensuring the correct padding and dimensionality.",
