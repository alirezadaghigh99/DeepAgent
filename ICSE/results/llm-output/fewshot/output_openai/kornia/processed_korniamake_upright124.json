    "result": "To create a function `make_upright` that rectifies an affine matrix to make it upright, we need to follow the steps you described. This involves checking the validity of the input, computing the determinant, performing operations equivalent to a 2x2 Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and then scaling the matrix. Below is a Python implementation using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef KORNIA_CHECK_LAF(laf):\n    # Placeholder for the actual check function\n    if laf.shape[-2:] != (2, 3):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input LAF must have shape (B, N, 2, 3)\")\n\ndef make_upright(laf: torch.Tensor, eps: float = 1e-6) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Rectifies an affine matrix to make it upright.\n\n    Args:\n        laf (torch.Tensor): Input tensor of shape (B, N, 2, 3).\n        eps (float, optional): Small value for safe division. Defaults to 1e-6.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: Rectified affine matrix of the same shape (B, N, 2, 3).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check the validity of the input affine matrix\n    KORNIA_CHECK_LAF(laf)\n\n    # Extract the 2x2 affine part of the matrix\n    A = laf[..., :2, :2]\n\n    # Compute the determinant of the 2x2 matrix\n    det = torch.det(A)\n\n    # Perform operations equivalent to a 2x2 SVD\n    U, S, Vt = torch.linalg.svd(A)\n\n    # Set the rotation matrix to identity\n    R = torch.eye(2, device=laf.device, dtype=laf.dtype).expand_as(A)\n\n    # Scale the identity matrix with the original determinant\n    S_matrix = torch.diag_embed(S)\n    rectified_A = R @ S_matrix\n\n    # Normalize by the determinant to maintain the original scale\n    scale_factor = det.unsqueeze(-1).unsqueeze(-1).sqrt().clamp(min=eps)\n    rectified_A = rectified_A / scale_factor\n\n    # Replace the original 2x2 part with the rectified one\n    rectified_laf = laf.clone()\n    rectified_laf[..., :2, :2] = rectified_A\n\n    return rectified_laf\n\n# Example usage\nB, N = 2, 3  # Batch size and number of matrices\nlaf = torch.rand(B, N, 2, 3)  # Random affine matrices\nrectified_laf = make_upright(laf)\nprint(rectified_laf)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **KORNIA_CHECK_LAF**: This is a placeholder function to check the validity of the input. You should replace it with the actual check function from Kornia or your own implementation.\n- **Determinant Calculation**: The determinant of the 2x2 part of the affine matrix is calculated to understand the scaling factor.\n- **SVD**: Singular Value Decomposition is used to decompose the matrix into its rotational and scaling components.\n- **Rectification**: The rotation matrix is set to identity, and the matrix is scaled using the original determinant to maintain the scale.\n- **Normalization**: The matrix is normalized by the determinant to ensure numerical stability and maintain the original scale.\n\nThis function should work for any batch size `B` and number of matrices `N`, as long as the input tensor `laf` has the shape `(B, N, 2, 3)`.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called make_upright that rectifies an affine matrix to make it upright. The function takes in a tensor laf of shape (B, N, 2, 3) and an optional float eps for safe division. It returns the rectified affine matrix laf of the same shape (B, N, 2, 3). The function first checks the validity of the input affine matrix using KORNIA_CHECK_LAF. It then calculates the determinant of the affine matrix and uses it to rectify the matrix by resetting the rotation matrix to an identity. The function performs operations equivalent to a 2x2 SVD and sets the rotation matrix to an identity. The rectified affine matrix is then scaled using the original determinant and returned. An example usage of the function is provided using torch tensors.",
