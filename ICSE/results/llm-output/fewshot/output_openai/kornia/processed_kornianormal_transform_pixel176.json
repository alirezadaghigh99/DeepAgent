    "result": "To create the `normal_transform_pixel` function, we need to compute a transformation matrix that normalizes pixel coordinates to the range \\([-1, 1]\\). This involves scaling and translating the pixel coordinates based on the image dimensions. Here's how you can implement this function in Python using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef normal_transform_pixel(\n    height: int,\n    width: int,\n    eps: float = 1e-14,\n    device: Optional[torch.device] = None,\n    dtype: Optional[torch.dtype] = None\n) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the normalization matrix from image size in pixels to the range [-1, 1].\n\n    Args:\n        height (int): The height of the image in pixels.\n        width (int): The width of the image in pixels.\n        eps (float): A small epsilon value to prevent division by zero. Default is 1e-14.\n        device (torch.device, optional): The device on which to create the tensor. Defaults to None.\n        dtype (torch.dtype, optional): The desired data type of the returned tensor. Defaults to None.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: A normalized transform matrix with shape (1, 3, 3).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate scale factors\n    scale_x = 2.0 / (width - 1 + eps)\n    scale_y = 2.0 / (height - 1 + eps)\n\n    # Create the transformation matrix\n    transform_matrix = torch.tensor([\n        [scale_x, 0, -1],\n        [0, scale_y, -1],\n        [0, 0, 1]\n    ], dtype=dtype, device=device)\n\n    # Add an additional dimension of size 1 at the beginning\n    transform_matrix = transform_matrix.unsqueeze(0)\n\n    return transform_matrix\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Scale Factors**: The scale factors `scale_x` and `scale_y` are calculated to map the pixel coordinates to the range \\([-1, 1]\\). The formula \\(2.0 / (width - 1 + \\text{eps})\\) ensures that the transformation is robust to very small image dimensions by adding a small epsilon value.\n- **Transformation Matrix**: The matrix is constructed to scale and translate the pixel coordinates. The translation terms \\(-1\\) ensure that the center of the image maps to the origin \\((0, 0)\\) in the normalized space.\n- **Tensor Creation**: The transformation matrix is created as a PyTorch tensor, with optional `device` and `dtype` parameters to specify the desired device and data type.\n- **Output Shape**: The matrix is reshaped to have an additional dimension of size 1 at the beginning, resulting in a shape of \\((1, 3, 3)\\).",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called normal_transform_pixel that computes the normalization matrix from image size in pixels to the range [-1, 1]. The function takes input parameters height (integer), width (integer), eps (float, default value 1e-14), device (optional torch.device), and dtype (optional torch.dtype). \n\nThe function returns a normalized transform matrix with shape (1, 3, 3) as a Tensor. It returns the transformed matrix with an additional dimension of size 1 at the beginning (1x3x3).",
