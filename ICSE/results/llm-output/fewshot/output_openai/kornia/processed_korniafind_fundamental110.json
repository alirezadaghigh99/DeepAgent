    "result": "To generate a Python function called `find_fundamental`, which computes the fundamental matrix from two sets of points in two images, you can use the following code. This function will support the \"7POINT\" and \"8POINT\" methods for computing the fundamental matrix. Note that this implementation assumes the use of PyTorch for tensor operations.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef find_fundamental(points1: torch.Tensor, points2: torch.Tensor, weights: torch.Tensor, method: str = \"8POINT\") -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the fundamental matrix from two sets of points in two images.\n\n    Args:\n        points1 (torch.Tensor): A set of points in the first image with a tensor shape (B, N, 2), N>=8.\n        points2 (torch.Tensor): A set of points in the second image with a tensor shape (B, N, 2), N>=8.\n        weights (torch.Tensor): Tensor containing the weights per point correspondence with a shape of (B, N).\n        method (str): The method to use for computing the fundamental matrix. Supported methods are \"7POINT\" and \"8POINT\".\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: The computed fundamental matrix with shape (B, 3*m, 3), where `m` is the number of fundamental matrices.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If an invalid method is provided.\n    \"\"\"\n    if method not in [\"7POINT\", \"8POINT\"]:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Invalid method '{method}'.

The \"8POINT\" method is implemented, while the \"7POINT\" method requires additional steps to solve for the linear combination of two matrices that results in a rank 2 matrix. You may need to implement the specifics of the 7-point algorithm if required.",
