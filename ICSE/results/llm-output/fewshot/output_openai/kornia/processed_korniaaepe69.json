It then calculates the squared differences between the corresponding elements of the input and target flow maps. The sum of these squared differences is computed along the last dimension, and the square root of this sum gives the endpoint error for each element. Depending on the specified reduction method, the function returns the AEPE as a tensor or a scalar.",
