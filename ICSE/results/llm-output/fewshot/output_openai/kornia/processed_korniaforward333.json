    "result": "To implement the `forward` method for the `STEFunction` class, you need to define how the function behaves during the forward pass. The `forward` method should return the output tensor, which in this case is the same as the input tensor since the function is meant to act as an identity function during the forward pass. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nfrom torch.autograd import Function\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom typing import Any, Optional, Callable\n\nclass STEFunction(Function):\n    \"\"\"Straight-Through Estimation (STE) function.\n\n    STE bridges the gradients between the input tensor and output tensor as if the function\n    was an identity function. Meanwhile, advanced gradient functions are also supported. e.g.\n    the output gradients can be mapped into [-1, 1] with ``F.hardtanh`` function.\n\n    Args:\n        grad_fn: function to restrain the gradient received. If None, no mapping will performed.\n\n    Example:\n        Let the gradients of ``torch.sign`` estimated from STE.\n        >>> input = torch.randn(4, requires_grad = True)\n        >>> output = torch.sign(input)\n        >>> loss = output.mean()\n        >>> loss.backward()\n        >>> input.grad\n        tensor([0., 0., 0., 0.])\n\n        >>> with torch.no_grad():\n        ...     output = torch.sign(input)\n        >>> out_est = STEFunction.apply(input, output)\n        >>> loss = out_est.mean()\n        >>> loss.backward()\n        >>> input.grad\n        tensor([0.2500, 0.2500, 0.2500, 0.2500])\n    \"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def forward(ctx: Any, input: Tensor, output: Tensor, grad_fn: Optional[Callable[..., Any]] = None) -> Tensor:\n        # Save the gradient function for use in the backward pass\n        ctx.grad_fn = grad_fn\n        # Return the output tensor, which is the same as the input tensor\n        return output\n```\n\nIn this implementation, the `forward` method simply returns the `output` tensor, which is the same as the `input` tensor in the context of the STE function. The `ctx` object is used to store the `grad_fn` for use in the backward pass, which you would implement in the `backward` method. The `forward` method does not modify the input or output tensors; it merely passes them through.",
