    "result": "To complete the function `projection_from_KRt`, we need to construct the projection matrix \\( P \\) from the given camera matrix \\( K \\), rotation matrix \\( R \\), and translation vector \\( t \\). The projection matrix is computed as \\( P = K \\cdot [R|t] \\), where \\([R|t]\\) is the concatenation of \\( R \\) and \\( t \\) along the last axis. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\n\ndef projection_from_KRt(K: Tensor, R: Tensor, t: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Get the projection matrix P from K, R, and t.\n\n    This function estimates the projection matrix by solving the following equation: P = K * [R|t].\n\n    Args:\n        K: The camera matrix with the intrinsics with shape (B, 3, 3).\n        R: The rotation matrix with shape (B, 3, 3).\n        t: The translation vector with shape (B, 3, 1).\n\n    Returns:\n        The projection matrix P with shape (B, 3, 4).\n    \"\"\"\n    if K.shape[-2:] != (3, 3):\n        raise AssertionError(f\"Expected K to have shape (B, 3, 3), but got {K.shape}\")\n    if R.shape[-2:] != (3, 3):\n        raise AssertionError(f\"Expected R to have shape (B, 3, 3), but got {R.shape}\")\n    if t.shape[-2:] != (3, 1):\n        raise AssertionError(f\"Expected t to have shape (B, 3, 1), but got {t.shape}\")\n    if not len(K.shape) == len(R.shape) == len(t.shape):\n        raise AssertionError(\"K, R, and t must have the same batch dimension\")\n\n    # Concatenate R and t to form [R|t]\n    Rt = torch.cat((R, t), dim=-1)  # Shape: (B, 3, 4)\n\n    # Compute the projection matrix P\n    P = torch.bmm(K, Rt)  # Shape: (B, 3, 4)\n\n    return P\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Validation**: The function first checks that the input matrices \\( K \\), \\( R \\), and \\( t \\) have the expected shapes. If not, it raises an `AssertionError`.\n- **Concatenation**: The rotation matrix \\( R \\) and the translation vector \\( t \\) are concatenated along the last dimension to form a matrix of shape \\((B, 3, 4)\\).\n- **Matrix Multiplication**: The projection matrix \\( P \\) is computed by performing a batch matrix multiplication of \\( K \\) and \\([R|t]\\) using `torch.bmm`, resulting in a matrix of shape \\((B, 3, 4)\\).\n- **Return**: The function returns the computed projection matrix \\( P \\).",
