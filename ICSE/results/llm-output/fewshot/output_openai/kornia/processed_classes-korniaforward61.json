    "result": "To implement the `forward` method for the `DiceLoss` class, we need to compute the S\u00f8rensen-Dice Coefficient loss for multi-class segmentation tasks. The method should handle both 'micro' and 'macro' reduction methods, include numerical stability with `eps`, and support class weighting with `weight`. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass DiceLoss(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, average: str = \"micro\", eps: float = 1e-8, weight: Optional[Tensor] = None) -> None:\n        super(DiceLoss, self).__init__()\n        if average not in [\"micro\", \"macro\"]:\n            raise ValueError(\"average must be either 'micro' or 'macro'\")\n        self.average = average\n        self.eps = eps\n        self.weight = weight\n\n    def forward(self, pred: Tensor, target: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # Ensure predictions are probabilities\n        pred = torch.softmax(pred, dim=1)\n        \n        # One-hot encode the target\n        target_one_hot = torch.nn.functional.one_hot(target, num_classes=pred.shape[1]).permute(0, 3, 1, 2).float()\n        \n        # Calculate intersection and union\n        intersection = torch.sum(pred * target_one_hot, dim=(2, 3))\n        union = torch.sum(pred, dim=(2, 3)) + torch.sum(target_one_hot, dim=(2, 3))\n        \n        # Calculate Dice score\n        dice_score = (2.0 * intersection + self.eps) / (union + self.eps)\n        \n        if self.average == \"micro\":\n            # Micro: calculate the loss across all classes\n            dice_loss = 1.0 - torch.mean(dice_score)\n        elif self.average == \"macro\":\n            # Macro: calculate the loss for each class separately and average\n            if self.weight is not None:\n                if self.weight.shape[0] != pred.shape[1]:\n                    raise ValueError(\"Weight tensor must have the same number of elements as there are classes\")\n                dice_loss = 1.0 - torch.mean(dice_score * self.weight)\n            else:\n                dice_loss = 1.0 - torch.mean(dice_score, dim=1)\n        \n        return dice_loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Softmax Activation**: The predicted scores `pred` are converted to probabilities using the softmax function along the class dimension.\n\n2. **One-Hot Encoding**: The ground truth labels `target` are converted to a one-hot encoded format to match the shape of `pred`.\n\n3. **Intersection and Union**: The intersection and union of the predicted and target masks are computed for each class.\n\n4. **Dice Score Calculation**: The Dice score is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Dice Score} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{Intersection} + \\text{eps}}{\\text{Union} + \\text{eps}}\n   \\]\n   The `eps` is added for numerical stability to prevent division by zero.\n\n5. **Reduction Methods**:\n   - **Micro**: The loss is calculated across all classes by averaging the Dice scores.\n   - **Macro**: The loss is calculated for each class separately and then averaged. If class weights are provided, they are applied to the Dice scores before averaging.\n\n6. **Class Weighting**: If `weight` is provided, it is used to weight the Dice scores for each class in the macro reduction method. The weight tensor should have the same number of elements as there are classes.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `forward` for the `DiceLoss` class that computes the S\u00f8rensen-Dice Coefficient loss for multi-class segmentation tasks. The method should take as input the predicted scores `pred` and the ground truth labels `target`, and return the computed Dice loss. The method should support two reduction methods: `'micro'` (calculates the loss across all classes) and `'macro'` (calculates the loss for each class separately and averages the loss across classes). The loss should also include options for numerical stability with `eps` and class weighting with `weight`.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass DiceLoss(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, average: str = \"micro\", eps: float = 1e-8, weight: Optional[Tensor] = None) -> None:\n        self.average = average\n        self.eps = eps\n        self.weight = weight\n\n    def forward(self, pred: Tensor, target: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
