    "result": "To implement the function `sample_is_valid_for_homography`, we need to follow the steps outlined in your description. The function will check the validity of a sample for homography estimation using the oriented constraint check from Marquez-Neila2015. Here's how you can implement this function in Python using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef sample_is_valid_for_homography(points1: torch.Tensor, points2: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if the minimal sample is valid for homography estimation using the oriented constraint.\n\n    Args:\n        points1 (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape (B, 4, 2) representing the first set of points.\n        points2 (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape (B, 4, 2) representing the second set of points.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: A mask of shape (B, 3, 3) indicating the validity of the sample for each batch.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the shapes of points1 and points2 are equal\n    if points1.shape != points2.shape:\n        raise ValueError(\"The shapes of points1 and points2 must be equal.\")\n\n    # Convert points to homogeneous coordinates\n    def to_homogeneous(points):\n        ones = torch.ones((points.shape[0], points.shape[1], 1), dtype=points.dtype, device=points.device)\n        return torch.cat((points, ones), dim=-1)\n\n    points1_hom = to_homogeneous(points1)\n    points2_hom = to_homogeneous(points2)\n\n    # Compute the oriented constraint\n    def oriented_constraint(p1, p2):\n        # Compute cross products\n        cross1 = torch.cross(p1[:, 1] - p1[:, 0], p1[:, 2] - p1[:, 0])\n        cross2 = torch.cross(p2[:, 1] - p2[:, 0], p2[:, 2] - p2[:, 0])\n        return (cross1 * cross2).sum(dim=-1) > 0\n\n    # Determine if the sample is valid for homography estimation\n    validity_mask = oriented_constraint(points1_hom, points2_hom)\n\n    # Create a mask of shape (B, 3, 3) based on the validity\n    mask = validity_mask.unsqueeze(-1).unsqueeze(-1).expand(-1, 3, 3)\n\n    return mask\n\n# Example usage\npoints1 = torch.rand((5, 4, 2))\npoints2 = torch.rand((5, 4, 2))\nvalidity_mask = sample_is_valid_for_homography(points1, points2)\nprint(validity_mask)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Shape Check**: The function first checks if the shapes of `points1` and `points2` are equal. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Homogeneous Coordinates**: The function converts the 2D points to homogeneous coordinates by appending a column of ones.\n\n3. **Oriented Constraint**: The oriented constraint is computed using cross products of vectors formed by the points. The constraint checks if the cross products have the same orientation.\n\n4. **Validity Mask**: The function returns a mask of shape `(B, 3, 3)` indicating the validity of the sample for each batch. The mask is expanded from the validity check result to match the desired shape.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the oriented constraint is based on the cross product of vectors formed by the points, which is a common approach in homography estimation. Adjust the constraint logic as needed based on the specific details from Marquez-Neila2015.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called sample_is_valid_for_homography that implements the oriented constraint check from Marquez-Neila2015. The function takes two input tensors, points1 and points2, each with a shape of (B, 4, 2), where B is the batch size. The function returns a mask with the minimal sample that is good for homography estimation, with a shape of (B, 3, 3). The function first checks if the shapes of points1 and points2 are equal, then converts the points to homogeneous coordinates. and finally determines if the sample is valid for homography estimation. The output is a tensor representing the validity of the sample for each batch.",
