    "result": "Creating a function to perform JPEG encoding on a batch of RGB images involves several steps, including color space conversion, downsampling, discrete cosine transform (DCT), quantization, and entropy encoding. Below is a simplified version of the `_jpeg_encode` function that focuses on the core steps of JPEG encoding. Note that this implementation is a high-level overview and may not include all optimizations and details found in a full JPEG encoder.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef _jpeg_encode(\n    image_rgb: torch.Tensor,\n    jpeg_quality: torch.Tensor,\n    quantization_table_y: torch.Tensor,\n    quantization_table_c: torch.Tensor\n) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform JPEG encoding on a batch of RGB images.\n\n    Args:\n        image_rgb (Tensor): Tensor of shape (B, 3, H, W) representing a batch of RGB images.\n        jpeg_quality (Tensor): Tensor of shape (B) representing the JPEG compression quality for each image.\n        quantization_table_y (Tensor): Quantization table for the Y (luminance) channel.\n        quantization_table_c (Tensor): Quantization table for the Cb and Cr (chrominance) channels.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple[Tensor, Tensor, Tensor]: Encoded Y, Cb, and Cr components.\n    \"\"\"\n    B, _, H, W = image_rgb.shape\n\n    # Convert RGB to YCbCr\n    def rgb_to_ycbcr(image):\n        matrix = torch.tensor([[0.299, 0.587, 0.114],\n                               [-0.1687, -0.3313, 0.5],\n                               [0.5, -0.4187, -0.0813]], dtype=image.dtype, device=image.device)\n        shift = torch.tensor([0, 128, 128], dtype=image.dtype, device=image.device)\n        return torch.tensordot(image.permute(0, 2, 3, 1), matrix, dims=1) + shift\n\n    ycbcr = rgb_to_ycbcr(image_rgb)\n\n    # Downsample Cb and Cr channels (4:2:0 chroma subsampling)\n    y = ycbcr[:, 0, :, :]\n    cb = F.avg_pool2d(ycbcr[:, 1, :, :].unsqueeze(1), kernel_size=2).squeeze(1)\n    cr = F.avg_pool2d(ycbcr[:, 2, :, :].unsqueeze(1), kernel_size=2).squeeze(1)\n\n    # Function to perform block-wise DCT and quantization\n    def block_dct_quantize(channel, quant_table):\n        # Divide the channel into 8x8 blocks\n        channel = channel.unfold(1, 8, 8).unfold(2, 8, 8)\n        B, H_blocks, W_blocks, _, _, _ = channel.shape\n        channel = channel.contiguous().view(B, H_blocks * W_blocks, 8, 8)\n\n        # Apply DCT\n        dct_blocks = torch.dct(channel, norm='ortho')\n\n        # Quantize\n        quantized_blocks = torch.round(dct_blocks / quant_table)\n\n        return quantized_blocks\n\n    # Quantize each channel\n    y_encoded = block_dct_quantize(y, quantization_table_y)\n    cb_encoded = block_dct_quantize(cb, quantization_table_c)\n    cr_encoded = block_dct_quantize(cr, quantization_table_c)\n\n    return y_encoded, cb_encoded, cr_encoded\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Color Space Conversion**: The function converts RGB images to YCbCr color space, which separates luminance (Y) from chrominance (Cb and Cr).\n- **Chroma Subsampling**: The Cb and Cr channels are downsampled using 4:2:0 chroma subsampling, which reduces the resolution of the chrominance channels.\n- **Block-wise DCT and Quantization**: The function divides each channel into 8x8 blocks, applies the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and then quantizes the DCT coefficients using the provided quantization tables.\n- **JPEG Quality**: The `jpeg_quality` parameter is included but not directly used in this simplified version. In a full implementation, it would adjust the quantization tables based on the quality setting.\n\nThis code provides a basic framework for JPEG encoding, but a complete implementation would include additional steps such as zigzag ordering, run-length encoding, and Huffman coding for entropy encoding.",
