    "result": "To implement the `_perform_padding` function, we need to ensure that the height and width of the image are both divisible by 16. This involves calculating the necessary padding for each dimension and then applying it to the image. Here's how you can complete the function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\n\ndef _perform_padding(image: Tensor) -> tuple[Tensor, int, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Pads a given image to be divisible by 16.\n\n    Args:\n        image: Image of the shape (*, 3, H, W).\n\n    Returns:\n        image_padded: Padded image of the shape (*, 3, H_new, W_new).\n        h_pad: Padded pixels along the horizontal axis.\n        w_pad: Padded pixels along the vertical axis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the current height and width of the image\n    _, _, H, W = image.shape\n\n    # Calculate the padding needed to make H and W divisible by 16\n    h_pad = (16 - H % 16) % 16\n    w_pad = (16 - W % 16) % 16\n\n    # Apply padding to the image\n    padding = (0, w_pad, 0, h_pad)  # (left, right, top, bottom)\n    image_padded = torch.nn.functional.pad(image, padding, mode='constant', value=0)\n\n    return image_padded, h_pad, w_pad\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Calculate Padding**: We calculate the padding required for both the height (`H`) and width (`W`) to make them divisible by 16. The formula `(16 - H % 16) % 16` ensures that if `H` is already divisible by 16, no padding is added.\n- **Apply Padding**: We use `torch.nn.functional.pad` to apply the calculated padding. The `padding` tuple specifies the amount of padding to add to each side of the image: `(left, right, top, bottom)`.\n- **Return Values**: The function returns the padded image along with the number of pixels added to the height and width.",
