    "result": "Certainly! Below is a Python function `normal_transform_pixel3d` that computes a normalization matrix to transform image coordinates from pixel space to the range [-1, 1].

The scaling factors are calculated as `2.0 / (size - 1)` for each dimension, with an epsilon added to prevent division by zero.\n- **Translation Factors**: The last column of the matrix is set to -1 to shift the range from [0, size-1] to [-1, 1].\n- **Output Shape**: The matrix is reshaped to (1, 4, 4) to match the desired output shape.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called normal_transform_pixel3d that computes the normalization matrix from image size in pixels to the range [-1, 1]. The function takes in the image depth, height, width, epsilon value (eps), device, and data type (dtype) as inputs. It returns a normalized transform matrix with a shape of (1, 4, 4). The function first creates a 4x4 tensor matrix and then adjusts the values based on the image dimensions to prevent divide-by-zero errors. Finally, it returns the normalized transform matrix with a shape of 1x4x4.",
