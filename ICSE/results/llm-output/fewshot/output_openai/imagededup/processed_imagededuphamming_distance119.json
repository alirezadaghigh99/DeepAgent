    "result": "To create a Python function that calculates the Hamming distance between two hash strings, you can follow these steps. The Hamming distance is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols in two strings of equal length are different. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef hamming_distance(hash1: str, hash2: str) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the Hamming distance between two hash strings.\n\n    The function pads the hashes to 64 bits if they are not already of that length.\n\n    Args:\n        hash1 (str): The first hash string.\n        hash2 (str): The second hash string.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The Hamming distance between the two hashes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure both hashes are 64 bits long by padding with zeros if necessary\n    hash1 = hash1.ljust(64, '0')\n    hash2 = hash2.ljust(64, '0')\n\n    # Calculate the Hamming distance\n    distance = sum(c1 != c2 for c1, c2 in zip(hash1, hash2))\n\n    return float(distance)\n\n# Example usage:\nhash1 = \"1101\"\nhash2 = \"1001\"\ndistance = hamming_distance(hash1, hash2)\nprint(f\"Hamming distance: {distance}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Padding**: The function uses `ljust(64, '0')` to pad each hash to 64 bits if they are shorter. This ensures that both strings are of equal length before calculating the Hamming distance.\n- **Distance Calculation**: The Hamming distance is calculated by iterating over the characters of both strings simultaneously and counting the number of positions where the characters differ.\n- **Return Type**: The function returns the Hamming distance as a `float`, as specified in the requirements.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called hamming_distance that calculates the Hamming distance between two hash strings. The function takes two input parameters, hash1 and hash2, both of type string. The function returns a float value representing the Hamming distance between the two hashes. If the length of the hashes is not 64 bits, the function pads the length to be 64 for each hash before calculating the Hamming distance. The output is the calculated Hamming distance between the two hashes.",
