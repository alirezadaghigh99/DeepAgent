    "result": "To generate a Python method called `_get_cnn_features_batch` that processes images from a directory and returns a dictionary mapping filenames to CNN encodings, you can follow the structure below. This method will use a pre-trained CNN model from PyTorch, such as ResNet, to extract features from the images. It will also handle bad images and provide logging information.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom pathlib import PurePath\nfrom typing import Optional, Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport torch\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\nfrom torchvision import models, transforms\nfrom torchvision.datasets import ImageFolder\nfrom torchvision.io import read_image\nimport logging\n\ndef _get_cnn_features_batch(\n    image_dir: PurePath,\n    recursive: Optional[bool] = False,\n    num_workers: int = 0\n) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate CNN encodings for all images in a given directory.\n\n    Args:\n        image_dir (PurePath): Directory containing images.\n        recursive (bool, optional): Whether to search directories recursively.

Adjustments may be needed based on specific requirements or different model architectures.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method called `_get_cnn_features_batch` that takes in parameters `image_dir` of type `PurePath`, `recursive` of type `Optional[bool]` with a default value of `False`, and `num_workers` of type `int` with a default value of `0`. The method returns a dictionary mapping filenames to corresponding numpy arrays of CNN encodings.\n\nThe method generates CNN encodings for all images in a given directory of images. It initializes a data loader, processes the images using a model, and creates a dictionary mapping filenames to their respective encodings. The method handles bad images and provides logging information throughout the process.",
