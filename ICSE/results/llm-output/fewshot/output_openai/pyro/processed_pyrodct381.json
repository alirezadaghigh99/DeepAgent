    "result": "To implement a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) of type II in PyTorch, scaled to be orthonormal, you can follow the structure of the `scipy.fftpack.dct` function with `norm=\"ortho\"`. Here's how you can write such a function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef dct(x: torch.Tensor, dim: int = -1) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) of type II, scaled to be orthonormal.\n\n    This function is the inverse of the IDCT of type II and is equivalent to\n    `scipy.fftpack.dct` with `norm=\"ortho\"`.\n\n    :param x: The input signal.\n    :param dim: Dimension along which to compute the DCT.\n    :return: The DCT transformed signal.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure the input is a float tensor\n    x = x.to(torch.float32)\n\n    # Get the size of the dimension along which to compute the DCT\n    N = x.size(dim)\n\n    # Create a tensor of cosine basis functions\n    n = torch.arange(N, dtype=torch.float32, device=x.device)\n    k = n.view(-1, 1)\n    cos_basis = torch.cos((torch.pi / N) * (n + 0.5) * k)\n\n    # Compute the DCT using matrix multiplication\n    result = torch.matmul(cos_basis, x.transpose(dim, -1))\n\n    # Scale the result to be orthonormal\n    result[0] *= 1.0 / torch.sqrt(torch.tensor(2.0, device=x.device))\n    result *= torch.sqrt(2.0 / N)\n\n    # Transpose back to the original dimension order\n    return result.transpose(dim, -1)\n\n# Example usage:\n# x = torch.randn(10)\n# dct_result = dct(x)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Tensor**: The function takes a tensor `x` and computes the DCT along the specified dimension `dim`.\n- **Cosine Basis**: It constructs a cosine basis matrix for the DCT computation.\n- **Matrix Multiplication**: The DCT is computed using matrix multiplication between the cosine basis and the input tensor.\n- **Orthonormal Scaling**: The result is scaled to ensure orthonormality, which is consistent with `scipy.fftpack.dct` with `norm=\"ortho\"`.\n- **Transpose**: The result is transposed back to match the original dimension order of the input tensor.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input tensor is one-dimensional along the specified dimension. If you need to handle multi-dimensional inputs, you may need to adjust the implementation to handle broadcasting and reshaping appropriately.",
