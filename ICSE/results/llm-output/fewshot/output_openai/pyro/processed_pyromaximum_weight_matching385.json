    "result": "To create a function `maximum_weight_matching` that takes logits as a tensor and returns a tensor of optimal assignments based on a maximum-weight matching, we can use the `scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment` function, which implements the Hungarian algorithm. This algorithm is efficient for solving the assignment problem, which is a special case of the maximum-weight matching problem in bipartite graphs.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `maximum_weight_matching` function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment\n\ndef maximum_weight_matching(logits: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform maximum-weight matching on the input logits tensor and return the optimal assignments.\n\n    Args:\n        logits (torch.Tensor): A 2D tensor of shape (n, m) representing the weights or scores\n                               for each possible assignment between n and m elements.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: A 1D tensor of shape (n,) containing the indices of the optimal assignments\n                      for each element in the first dimension.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert logits to a numpy array for use with scipy\n    logits_np = logits.detach().cpu().numpy()\n\n    # Use the Hungarian algorithm to find the optimal assignment\n    row_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(-logits_np)  # Negate to maximize\n\n    # Convert the result back to a torch tensor\n    optimal_assignments = torch.tensor(col_ind, dtype=torch.int64)\n\n    return optimal_assignments\n\n# Example usage:\n# logits = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 6.0, 5.0], [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]])\n# assignments = maximum_weight_matching(logits)\n# print(assignments)  # Output: tensor([2, 1, 0])\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Input**: The function takes a 2D tensor `logits` of shape `(n, m)`, where each element represents the weight or score for assigning an element from the first set to an element in the second set.\n- **Output**: The function returns a 1D tensor containing the indices of the optimal assignments for each element in the first dimension.\n- **Algorithm**: The function uses the `linear_sum_assignment` function from `scipy.optimize`, which implements the Hungarian algorithm. This algorithm finds the optimal assignment that maximizes the total weight (or minimizes the total cost, hence the negation of logits).\n- **No Gradients**: The function uses `detach()` to ensure that no gradients are computed, as required.\n\nThis implementation is efficient and leverages existing libraries to solve the problem optimally.",
