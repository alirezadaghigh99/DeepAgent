    "result": "To complete the `block_diag_embed` function, we need to create a block diagonal matrix from a batch of matrices. This involves placing each matrix along the diagonal of a larger matrix, with zeros elsewhere. Here's how you can implement this function using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef block_diag_embed(mat):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes a tensor of shape (..., B, M, N) and returns a block diagonal tensor\n    of shape (..., B x M, B x N).\n\n    :param torch.Tensor mat: an input tensor with 3 or more dimensions\n    :returns torch.Tensor: a block diagonal tensor with dimension `m.dim() - 1`\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the shape of the input tensor\n    *batch_dims, B, M, N = mat.shape\n    \n    # Create a zero tensor of the desired output shape\n    result_shape = (*batch_dims, B * M, B * N)\n    result = torch.zeros(result_shape, dtype=mat.dtype, device=mat.device)\n    \n    # Fill the block diagonal\n    for i in range(B):\n        result[..., i * M:(i + 1) * M, i * N:(i + 1) * N] = mat[..., i, :, :]\n    \n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Shape**: The input tensor `mat` has a shape of `(..., B, M, N)`, where `B` is the number of matrices, and `M` and `N` are the dimensions of each matrix.\n- **Output Shape**: The output tensor will have a shape of `(..., B * M, B * N)`, where each `M x N` matrix from the input is placed along the diagonal of the output tensor.\n- **Loop**: We loop over each matrix in the batch dimension `B` and place it in the appropriate block of the output tensor.\n- **Zero Tensor**: We initialize a zero tensor of the desired output shape and fill in the blocks with the input matrices.\n\nThis function will efficiently create a block diagonal matrix from a batch of matrices using PyTorch.",
