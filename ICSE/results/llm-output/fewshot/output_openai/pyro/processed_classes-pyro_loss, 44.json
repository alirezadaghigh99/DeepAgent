These traces contain the log probabilities needed for the loss calculations.\n- **Log Probabilities**: `log_joint_prob` and `log_guide_prob` are computed from the model and guide traces, respectively.\n- **Importance Weights**: These are calculated using the difference between the log joint and log guide probabilities. They are normalized to sum to 1.\n- **Loss Calculations**:\n  - `wake_theta_loss` is computed as the negative weighted sum of the log joint probabilities.\n  - `wake_phi_loss` is computed as the negative weighted sum of the log guide probabilities.\n  - `sleep_phi_loss` is optionally computed using traces from the unconditioned model and the guide.\n- **Combining Losses**: The final `phi_loss` is a combination of `wake_phi_loss` and `sleep_phi_loss`, weighted by the `insomnia` parameter.",
