    "result": "To create the `_calculate_knots` function as described, we need to perform a few key operations:\n\n1. Compute the cumulative sum of the `lengths` tensor.\n2. Scale and shift this cumulative sum to fit within the range defined by `lower` and `upper`.\n3. Ensure that the knot points start at `lower` and end at `upper`.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function in Python using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _calculate_knots(lengths: torch.Tensor, lower: float, upper: float) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate adjusted lengths and knot positions.\n\n    Args:\n        lengths (torch.Tensor): A tensor of lengths.\n        lower (float): The lower bound for the knot positions.\n        upper (float): The upper bound for the knot positions.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]: A tuple containing the adjusted lengths and knot positions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Compute the cumulative sum of lengths\n    cumulative_lengths = torch.cumsum(lengths, dim=0)\n\n    # Scale and shift the cumulative lengths to fit between lower and upper\n    total_length = cumulative_lengths[-1]\n    scale = (upper - lower) / total_length\n    knot_positions = cumulative_lengths * scale + lower\n\n    # Ensure the knot points start at lower and end at upper\n    knot_positions = torch.cat([torch.tensor([lower]), knot_positions[:-1], torch.tensor([upper])])\n\n    # Calculate adjusted lengths based on the new knot positions\n    adjusted_lengths = torch.diff(knot_positions)\n\n    return adjusted_lengths, knot_positions\n\n# Example usage:\nlengths = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\nlower = 0.0\nupper = 10.0\nadjusted_lengths, knot_positions = _calculate_knots(lengths, lower, upper)\nprint(\"Adjusted Lengths:\", adjusted_lengths)\nprint(\"Knot Positions:\", knot_positions)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Cumulative Sum**: We use `torch.cumsum` to compute the cumulative sum of the `lengths` tensor.\n- **Scaling and Shifting**: The cumulative sum is scaled to fit within the range `[lower, upper]` by calculating a `scale` factor. This factor is the ratio of the desired range (`upper - lower`) to the total length (`total_length`).\n- **Knot Positions**: We adjust the cumulative sum by scaling and then shifting it by `lower`. We ensure the first and last knot positions are exactly `lower` and `upper` by concatenating these values.\n- **Adjusted Lengths**: The adjusted lengths are computed as the differences between consecutive knot positions using `torch.diff`.\n\nThis function will return the adjusted lengths and the knot positions as required.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function _calculate_knots that takes lengths as a tensor, lower as a float, and upper as a float, and returns two tensors: the adjusted lengths and the knot positions. The function should scale and shift the cumulative sum of the lengths to fit between lower and upper, and ensure the knot points start at lower and end at upper.",
