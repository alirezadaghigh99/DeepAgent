The `pixel_scores` is optional.\n\n2. **Input Validation**:\n   - Raises a `ValueError` if `image_scores` is `None`.\n   - Raises a `ValueError` if `threshold` is `None` or not within the range [0, 1].\n\n3. **Processing**:\n   - If `pixel_scores` is provided, it checks that its first dimension matches the size of `image_scores`. It then returns a boolean mask indicating which pixels have scores below the threshold.\n   - If `pixel_scores` is not provided, it returns the indices of images with scores below the threshold.\n\nThis function provides a flexible way to identify issues based on either image-level or pixel-level scores, depending on the input provided.",
