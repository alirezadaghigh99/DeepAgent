It calculates the log loss for each model's predictions and aggregates them using the specified weights.\n\n4. **Adjusting Probabilities**: If `adjust_pred_probs` is set to `True`, the predicted probabilities are clipped to avoid extreme values that could lead to numerical instability.\n\n5. **Verbose Output**: If `verbose` is `True`, the function prints out the method used for computing the scores.\n\nThis implementation provides a basic framework for calculating label quality scores using an ensemble of models. You can extend it by adding more scoring methods or refining the existing logic based on your specific requirements.",
