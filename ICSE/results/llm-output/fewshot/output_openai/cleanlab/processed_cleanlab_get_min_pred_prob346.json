Below is the Python function `_get_min_pred_prob` as per your description:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef _get_min_pred_prob(predictions):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the minimum prediction probability from a list of NumPy arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        predictions (List[np.ndarray]): A list of NumPy arrays containing prediction probabilities.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The minimum prediction probability.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize pred_probs with a high value to avoid np.min on an empty array\n    pred_probs = [1.0]\n\n    # Iterate through each prediction array\n    for prediction in predictions:\n        # Extract the last column of each class prediction\n        if prediction.size > 0:\n            pred_probs.append(prediction[:, -1].min())\n\n    # Calculate and return the minimum value in pred_probs\n    return np.min(pred_probs)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**: The function starts by initializing a list `pred_probs` with a value of `1.0`. This ensures that if the input list is empty, calling `np.min` on `pred_probs` will not result in an error.\n- **Iteration**: It iterates over each NumPy array in the `predictions` list.\n- **Extraction**: For each prediction array, it extracts the last column (assuming it contains the class probabilities) and appends the minimum value of this column to `pred_probs`.\n- **Return**: Finally, it calculates the minimum value from `pred_probs` using `np.min` and returns it. This value represents the minimum prediction probability across all input predictions.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called _get_min_pred_prob that takes in a list of NumPy arrays called predictions. The function returns a float value which is the minimum prediction probability out of all the predictions in the input list. The function first initializes a list called pred_probs with a value of 1.0 to avoid calling np.min on an empty array. It then iterates through each prediction in the input list, extracts the last column of each class prediction, and appends it to the pred_probs list. Finally, the function calculates the minimum value in the pred_probs list using np.min and returns it as the output.",
