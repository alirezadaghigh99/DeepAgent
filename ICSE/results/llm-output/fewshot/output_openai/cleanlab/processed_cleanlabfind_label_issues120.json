    "result": "Creating a function to identify potentially mislabeled examples in a multi-label classification dataset involves several steps. The function will need to process the input labels and predicted probabilities, apply a method to identify label issues, and then rank and filter these issues based on the specified parameters. Below is a Python function `find_label_issues` that implements this logic:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.utils import check_random_state\nfrom joblib import Parallel, delayed\n\ndef find_label_issues(\n    labels,\n    pred_probs,\n    return_indices_ranked_by='confidence',\n    rank_by_kwargs=None,\n    filter_by='confident_joint',\n    frac_noise=0.1,\n    num_to_remove_per_class=None,\n    min_examples_per_class=5,\n    confident_joint=None,\n    n_jobs=1,\n    verbose=0,\n    low_memory=False\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identify potentially mislabeled examples in a multi-label classification dataset.\n\n    Args:\n        labels (list of list): Noisy labels for multi-label classification.\n        pred_probs (np.ndarray): Model-predicted class probabilities.\n        return_indices_ranked_by (str): Method to rank identified examples.\n        rank_by_kwargs (dict, optional): Additional arguments for ranking.\n        filter_by (str): Method to determine examples with label issues.\n        frac_noise (float): Fraction of label issues to return.\n        num_to_remove_per_class (int, optional): Number of mislabeled examples to return per class.\n        min_examples_per_class (int): Minimum number of examples required per class.\n        confident_joint (np.ndarray, optional): Confident joint array for multi-label classification.\n        n_jobs (int): Number of processing threads.\n        verbose (int): Print multiprocessing information.\n        low_memory (bool): Use limited memory.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: Indices of examples identified with label issues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Validate inputs\n    if not 0 <= frac_noise <= 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"frac_noise must be between 0 and 1.\")\n    \n    if num_to_remove_per_class is not None and num_to_remove_per_class < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"num_to_remove_per_class must be non-negative.\")\n\n    # Placeholder for the logic to identify label issues\n    # This could involve calculating the confident joint, filtering by confidence, etc.\n    # For simplicity, let's assume we have a function `identify_issues` that does this.\n    def identify_issues(labels, pred_probs, confident_joint, filter_by, low_memory):\n        # Implement the logic to identify label issues\n        # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation\n        # Return a list of indices with potential label issues\n        return np.random.choice(len(labels), size=int(frac_noise * len(labels)), replace=False)\n\n    # Identify label issues\n    issue_indices = identify_issues(labels, pred_probs, confident_joint, filter_by, low_memory)\n\n    # Rank the identified issues\n    if return_indices_ranked_by == 'confidence':\n        # Rank by confidence (or any other specified method)\n        # Placeholder for ranking logic\n        issue_indices = sorted(issue_indices, key=lambda idx: -np.max(pred_probs[idx]))\n\n    # Filter by class if specified\n    if num_to_remove_per_class is not None:\n        # Implement logic to filter by class\n        # Placeholder for filtering logic\n        pass\n\n    # Return the indices of examples with label issues\n    return np.array(issue_indices)\n\n# Example usage\nlabels = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 0], [1, 1]]\npred_probs = np.array([[0.8, 0.2], [0.6, 0.4], [0.1, 0.9], [0.7, 0.3]])\nindices_with_issues = find_label_issues(labels, pred_probs)\nprint(\"Indices with label issues:\", indices_with_issues)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Input Validation**: The function checks that `frac_noise` is between 0 and 1 and that `num_to_remove_per_class` is non-negative.\n- **Identify Issues**: A placeholder function `identify_issues` is used to simulate the identification of label issues. In practice, this would involve more sophisticated logic, potentially using the `confident_joint` or other methods.\n- **Ranking and Filtering**: The function ranks the identified issues based on the specified method (e.g., confidence) and can filter by class if `num_to_remove_per_class` is specified.\n- **Parallel Processing**: The function is designed to support parallel processing with `n_jobs`, though the example does not implement this for simplicity.\n\nThis function is a template and would need to be expanded with the actual logic for identifying and ranking label issues based on your specific requirements and dataset characteristics.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called find_label_issues that identifies potentially mislabeled examples in a multi-label classification dataset. The function takes in several parameters including labels (a list of noisy labels for multi-label classification), pred_probs (an array of model-predicted class probabilities), return_indices_ranked_by (specifies how to rank the identified examples with label issues), rank_by_kwargs (optional keyword arguments for ranking), filter_by (method to determine examples with label issues), frac_noise (fraction of label issues to return), num_to_remove_per_class (number of mislabeled examples to return per class), min_examples_per_class (minimum number of examples required per class), confident_joint (confident joint array for multi-label classification), n_jobs (number of processing threads), verbose (print multiprocessing information), and low_memory (flag for using limited memory). The function returns an array of indices of examples identified with label issues, sorted by the likelihood that all classes are correctly annotated for each example.",
