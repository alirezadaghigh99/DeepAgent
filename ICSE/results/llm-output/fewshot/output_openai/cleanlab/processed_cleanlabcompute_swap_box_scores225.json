    "result": "To create the `compute_swap_box_scores` function as described, we need to consider several aspects, such as handling the input parameters, calculating the swap scores, and managing cases where the number of annotated and predicted boxes differ. Below is a Python function that implements this logic:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_swap_box_scores(\n    labels: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]] = None,\n    predictions: Optional[List[np.ndarray]] = None,\n    alpha: float = 0.5,\n    high_probability_threshold: float = 0.9,\n    overlapping_label_check: bool = False,\n    auxiliary_inputs: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]] = None\n) -> List[np.ndarray]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate swap scores for annotated bounding boxes in images.\n\n    Args:\n        labels (List[Dict[str, Any]], optional): List of dictionaries containing labels for each image.\n        predictions (List[np.ndarray], optional): List of numpy arrays with model predictions for each image.\n        alpha (float): Weighting parameter for score calculation.\n        high_probability_threshold (float): Probability threshold for high confidence predictions.\n        overlapping_label_check (bool): Flag to check for overlapping labels.\n        auxiliary_inputs (List[Dict[str, Any]], optional): Additional inputs for each image.\n\n    Returns:\n        List[np.ndarray]: List of numpy arrays with swap scores for each image.\n    \"\"\"\n    if labels is None or predictions is None:\n        raise ValueError(\"Both 'labels' and 'predictions' must be provided.\")\n\n    swap_scores = []\n\n    for label_dict, prediction in zip(labels, predictions):\n        num_annotated_boxes = len(label_dict.get('boxes', []))\n        num_predicted_boxes = prediction.shape[0]\n\n        # Initialize scores with a default value\n        scores = np.ones(num_annotated_boxes)\n\n        for i, annotated_box in enumerate(label_dict.get('boxes', [])):\n            # Extract the predicted probabilities for the current box\n            predicted_probs = prediction[i] if i < num_predicted_boxes else np.zeros(prediction.shape[1])\n\n            # Calculate the score based on the predicted probabilities\n            max_prob = np.max(predicted_probs)\n            if max_prob > high_probability_threshold:\n                scores[i] = 1 - alpha * max_prob\n            else:\n                scores[i] = alpha * (1 - max_prob)\n\n            # Optional: Check for overlapping labels\n            if overlapping_label_check:\n                # Implement logic to adjust scores based on overlapping labels\n                pass\n\n            # Optional: Use auxiliary inputs to adjust scores\n            if auxiliary_inputs:\n                # Implement logic to adjust scores using auxiliary inputs\n                pass\n\n        swap_scores.append(scores)\n\n    return swap_scores\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Parameters**:\n   - `labels`: A list of dictionaries, each containing information about the annotated bounding boxes for each image.\n   - `predictions`: A list of numpy arrays, each containing the model's predicted probabilities for each bounding box in an image.\n   - `alpha`: A weighting parameter that influences the score calculation.\n   - `high_probability_threshold`: A threshold to determine high-confidence predictions.\n   - `overlapping_label_check`: A boolean flag to enable additional checks for overlapping labels.\n   - `auxiliary_inputs`: A list of dictionaries for additional inputs that might influence the score.\n\n2. **Score Calculation**:\n   - For each annotated box, the function calculates a score based on the predicted probabilities.\n   - If the maximum predicted probability for a box is above the `high_probability_threshold`, the score is adjusted to reflect high confidence.\n   - If the probability is below the threshold, the score is adjusted to reflect lower confidence.\n\n3. **Handling Varying Box Counts**:\n   - The function handles cases where the number of annotated and predicted boxes differ by initializing scores with a default value and adjusting based on available predictions.\n\n4. **Optional Checks**:\n   - The function includes placeholders for additional logic to handle overlapping labels and auxiliary inputs, which can be implemented as needed.\n\nThis function provides a framework for calculating swap scores, and you can further customize it based on specific requirements or additional data available.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called compute_swap_box_scores that calculates a numeric score for each annotated bounding box in each image, estimating the likelihood that the class label for this box was not accidentally swapped with another class. The function takes in several optional parameters including labels (a list of dictionaries containing labels for each image), predictions (a list of numpy arrays corresponding to model predictions for each image), alpha (a weighting parameter), high_probability_threshold (a probability threshold), overlapping_label_check (a boolean flag), and auxiliary_inputs (a list of dictionaries containing additional inputs for each image).\n\nThe function returns a list of numpy arrays where each element corresponds to the swap scores for annotated boxes in each image. The scores range between 0 and 1, with lower values indicating boxes that are more likely to have been mislabeled. The function also handles cases where the number of annotated and predicted boxes vary for each image.",
