    "result": "To create a function called `cluster_qr` that finds the discrete partition closest to the eigenvector embedding, you can use the QR decomposition method. This method is often used in spectral clustering to discretize the continuous embedding obtained from eigenvectors. Here's a Python function that implements this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.linalg import qr\n\ndef cluster_qr(vectors):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the discrete partition closest to the eigenvector embedding using QR decomposition.\n\n    Args:\n        vectors (array-like): An array of shape (n_samples, n_clusters) representing the embedding space of the samples.\n\n    Returns:\n        labels (np.ndarray): An array of integers with shape (n_samples,) representing the cluster labels of the vectors.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure the input is a numpy array\n    vectors = np.asarray(vectors)\n    \n    # Perform QR decomposition on the transposed vectors\n    _, r = qr(vectors.T, mode='economic')\n    \n    # Find the index of the maximum absolute value in each row of R\n    labels = np.argmax(np.abs(r), axis=1)\n    \n    return labels\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input**: The function takes an array-like object `vectors` with shape `(n_samples, n_clusters)`, which represents the embedding space of the samples.\n\n2. **QR Decomposition**: The QR decomposition is performed on the transposed `vectors` matrix. The `qr` function from `scipy.linalg` is used to obtain the R matrix, which is an upper triangular matrix.\n\n3. **Label Assignment**: The cluster labels are determined by finding the index of the maximum absolute value in each row of the R matrix. This index corresponds to the cluster assignment for each sample.\n\n4. **Output**: The function returns an array `labels` with shape `(n_samples,)`, where each element is an integer representing the cluster label of the corresponding sample.\n\nThis method is a common approach in spectral clustering to convert continuous embeddings into discrete cluster assignments.",
