    "result": "Certainly! Below is a Python function named `johnson_lindenstrauss_min_dim` that calculates the minimum number of components needed to guarantee a distortion rate within a specified range for a random projection, based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma.

It can be an integer or an array-like object.\n  - `eps`: The maximum distortion rate allowed. It can be a float or an array-like object.\n- **Output**: \n  - The function returns the minimal number of components required to ensure an eps-embedding with good probability.\n- **Validation**: \n  - The function checks if `eps` is within the valid range (0, 1).\n- **References**: \n  - The docstring includes references to the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma and related literature.\n- **Examples**: \n  - The docstring provides examples of how to use the function.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called johnson_lindenstrauss_min_dim that calculates the minimum number of components needed to guarantee a distortion rate within a specified range for a random projection. The function takes in the number of samples (n_samples) as an integer or array-like input and the maximum distortion rate (eps) as a float or array-like input. It returns the minimal number of components required to ensure an eps-embedding with good probability for the given number of samples. The function also includes references to the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma and provides examples of usage.",
