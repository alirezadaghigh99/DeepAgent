    "result": "Certainly! Below is a Python function called `extract_patches_2d` that reshapes a 2D image into a collection of patches. The function includes parameters for the original image data, patch size, maximum number of patches to extract, and random state for sampling. Additionally, I've included an example demonstrating how to use it with sample image data.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.image import extract_patches_2d as sk_extract_patches_2d\nfrom sklearn.utils import check_random_state\n\ndef extract_patches_2d(image, patch_size, max_patches=None, random_state=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reshape a 2D image into a collection of patches.\n\n    Args:\n        image (ndarray): Input image data of shape (height, width, channels).\n        patch_size (tuple): Size of the patches (patch_height, patch_width).\n        max_patches (int, optional): Maximum number of patches to extract. Defaults to None.\n        random_state (int, RandomState instance, or None, optional): Random state for sampling. Defaults to None.\n\n    Returns:\n        patches (ndarray): Array of patches extracted from the image, with shape \n                           (n_patches, patch_height, patch_width, channels).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Validate inputs\n    if len(image.shape) != 3:\n        raise ValueError(\"Image must be a 3D array with shape (height, width, channels).\")\n    \n    if len(patch_size) != 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Patch size must be a tuple of (patch_height, patch_width).\")\n    \n    # Use sklearn's extract_patches_2d function\n    patches = sk_extract_patches_2d(image, patch_size, max_patches=max_patches, random_state=random_state)\n    \n    return patches\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create a sample image of shape (100, 100, 3)\n    sample_image = np.random.rand(100, 100, 3)\n    \n    # Define patch size\n    patch_size = (10, 10)\n    \n    # Extract patches\n    patches = extract_patches_2d(sample_image, patch_size, max_patches=50, random_state=42)\n    \n    print(f\"Extracted {patches.shape[0]} patches of shape {patches.shape[1:]}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Function Parameters:**\n  - `image`: The input image data, expected to be a 3D NumPy array with dimensions (height, width, channels).\n  - `patch_size`: A tuple specifying the height and width of the patches to be extracted.\n  - `max_patches`: An optional parameter to limit the number of patches extracted. If `None`, all possible patches are extracted.\n  - `random_state`: An optional parameter to ensure reproducibility of the random sampling of patches.\n\n- **Functionality:**\n  - The function uses `sklearn.feature_extraction.image.extract_patches_2d` to handle the extraction of patches.\n  - It validates the input image and patch size to ensure they meet the expected format.\n  - The function returns an array of patches with the specified dimensions.\n\n- **Example Usage:**\n  - A sample image is created using random values.\n  - Patches of size 10x10 are extracted from the sample image.\n  - The number of extracted patches and their shape are printed.",
