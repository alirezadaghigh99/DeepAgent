    "result": "To implement the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm in Python, you can follow the structure outlined below. This implementation will include the main function `orthogonal_mp` with the specified parameters and functionality. The function will solve the OMP problem for each target in `y` and return the coefficients and optionally the number of iterations.\n\nHere's a basic implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.utils import check_array\nfrom sklearn.utils.extmath import safe_sparse_dot\n\ndef orthogonal_mp(X, y, n_nonzero_coefs=None, tol=None, precompute=False, copy_X=True, return_path=False, return_n_iter=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - X: array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)\n    - y: ndarray of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_targets)\n    - n_nonzero_coefs: int, optional\n        Desired number of non-zero entries in the solution.\n    - tol: float, optional\n        Maximum norm of the residual.\n    - precompute: bool, optional\n        Whether to precompute Gram matrix.\n    - copy_X: bool, optional\n        Whether to copy X.\n    - return_path: bool, optional\n        Whether to return the entire path of coefficients.\n    - return_n_iter: bool, optional\n        Whether to return the number of iterations.\n\n    Returns:\n    - coef: ndarray of shape (n_features,) or (n_features, n_targets)\n    - n_iters: int, optional\n        Number of active features across every target.\n    \"\"\"\n    X = check_array(X, copy=copy_X)\n    y = check_array(y, ensure_2d=False)\n\n    if y.ndim == 1:\n        y = y[:, np.newaxis]\n\n    n_samples, n_features = X.shape\n    n_targets = y.shape[1]\n\n    if n_nonzero_coefs is None and tol is None:\n        raise ValueError(\"Either n_nonzero_coefs or tol must be provided.\")\n\n    if precompute:\n        Gram = safe_sparse_dot(X.T, X)\n    else:\n        Gram = None\n\n    coef = np.zeros((n_features, n_targets))\n    n_iters = []\n\n    for k in range(n_targets):\n        residual = y[:, k]\n        indices = []\n        path = []\n\n        for _ in range(n_features):\n            if tol is not None and np.sum(residual ** 2) <= tol:\n                break\n\n            if precompute:\n                correlations = np.dot(X.T, residual)\n            else:\n                correlations = safe_sparse_dot(X.T, residual)\n\n            best_index = np.argmax(np.abs(correlations))\n            indices.append(best_index)\n\n            X_selected = X[:, indices]\n            coef_selected, _, _, _ = np.linalg.lstsq(X_selected, y[:, k], rcond=None)\n\n            residual = y[:, k] - np.dot(X_selected, coef_selected)\n\n            if return_path:\n                path.append(coef_selected)\n\n            if n_nonzero_coefs is not None and len(indices) >= n_nonzero_coefs:\n                break\n\n        coef[indices, k] = coef_selected\n        n_iters.append(len(indices))\n\n    if return_n_iter:\n        return coef, n_iters\n    return coef\n\n# Example usage:\nX = np.random.randn(100, 20)\ny = np.random.randn(100)\n\ncoef = orthogonal_mp(X, y, n_nonzero_coefs=5)\nprint(\"Coefficients:\", coef)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Parameters**: The function accepts various parameters to control the behavior of the OMP algorithm, such as the number of non-zero coefficients (`n_nonzero_coefs`) and the tolerance for the residual norm (`tol`).\n- **Precomputation**: The option to precompute the Gram matrix (`precompute`) can speed up the algorithm for large datasets.\n- **Return Options**: The function can return the entire path of coefficients and the number of iterations if specified.\n- **Example Usage**: An example is provided to demonstrate how to use the `orthogonal_mp` function with random data.\n\nThis implementation provides a basic structure for the OMP algorithm.

    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called orthogonal_mp that implements the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm. The function takes in input parameters X (array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)) and y (ndarray of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_targets)), along with optional parameters such as n_nonzero_coefs, tol, precompute, copy_X, return_path, and return_n_iter. \n\nThe function solves n_targets OMP problems by finding the coefficients of the OMP solution based on the input data X and targets y. The OMP problem is defined as finding the coefficients that minimize the residual error subject to constraints on the number of non-zero coefficients or the maximum squared norm of the residual.\n\nThe function returns the coefficients (coef) of the OMP solution as an ndarray of shape (n_features,) or (n_features, n_targets), along with the number of active features across every target (n_iters) if return_n_iter is set to True. Additionally, the function provides options to return the coefficient path and the number of iterations.\n\nThe OMP algorithm is based on the work by Mallat and Zhang in 1993 and Rubinstein, Zibulevsky, and Elad in 2008. The function includes examples demonstrating the usage of orthogonal_mp with sample data.",
