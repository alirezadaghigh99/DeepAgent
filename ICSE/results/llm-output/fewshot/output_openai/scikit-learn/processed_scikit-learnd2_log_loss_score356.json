    "result": "To create a function `d2_log_loss_score` that calculates the D\u00b2 score, which is the fraction of log loss explained, you can follow the structure and logic outlined below. This function will handle the inputs as specified and return the D\u00b2 score, while also managing edge cases like having fewer than two samples.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics import log_loss\nfrom sklearn.utils import check_array, check_consistent_length\nfrom sklearn.utils.multiclass import unique_labels\nfrom sklearn.utils.validation import _num_samples\nimport warnings\nfrom sklearn.exceptions import UndefinedMetricWarning\n\ndef d2_log_loss_score(y_true, y_pred, sample_weight=None, labels=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the D^2 score, which is the fraction of log loss explained.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - y_true: array-like or label indicator matrix, representing the actual labels for the samples.\n    - y_pred: array-like of shape (n_samples, n_classes) or (n_samples,), representing the predicted probabilities from a classifier.\n    - sample_weight: array-like of shape (n_samples,), representing sample weights.\n    - labels: array-like, representing the labels. If not provided, they will be inferred from y_true.\n\n    Returns:\n    - D^2 score as a float or ndarray of floats.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the number of samples is less than two\n    if _num_samples(y_pred) < 2:\n        msg = \"D^2 score is not well-defined with less than two samples.\"\n        warnings.warn(msg, UndefinedMetricWarning)\n        return float(\"nan\")\n\n    # Ensure y_true and y_pred are consistent\n    y_true = check_array(y_true, ensure_2d=False)\n    y_pred = check_array(y_pred, ensure_2d=False)\n    check_consistent_length(y_true, y_pred, sample_weight)\n\n    # Infer labels if not provided\n    if labels is None:\n        labels = unique_labels(y_true)\n\n    # Calculate the log loss of the model\n    model_log_loss = log_loss(y_true, y_pred, sample_weight=sample_weight, labels=labels)\n\n    # Calculate the log loss of a naive model that predicts the per-class proportions\n    y_true_proba = np.zeros_like(y_pred)\n    for i, label in enumerate(labels):\n        y_true_proba[y_true == label, i] = 1\n\n    naive_log_loss = log_loss(y_true, y_true_proba, sample_weight=sample_weight, labels=labels)\n\n    # Calculate the D^2 score\n    d2_score = 1 - (model_log_loss / naive_log_loss)\n\n    return d2_score\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Validation**: The function checks if the number of samples is less than two and issues a warning if so, returning `NaN`.\n- **Log Loss Calculation**: It calculates the log loss for both the model's predictions and a naive model that predicts the per-class proportions.\n- **D\u00b2 Score Calculation**: The D\u00b2 score is computed as `1 - (model_log_loss / naive_log_loss)`, representing the fraction of log loss explained by the model compared to a naive baseline.\n- **Handling Labels**: If labels are not provided, they are inferred from `y_true`.\n\nThis function should be robust for various input scenarios, including handling sample weights and different label configurations.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called d2_log_loss_score that calculates the D^2 score, which is the fraction of log loss explained. The function takes in the following parameters:\n\n- y_true: array-like or label indicator matrix, representing the actual labels for the samples.\n- y_pred: array-like of shape (n_samples, n_classes) or (n_samples,), representing the predicted probabilities from a classifier.\n- sample_weight: array-like of shape (n_samples,), representing sample weights.\n- labels: array-like, representing the labels. If not provided, they will be inferred from y_true.\n\nThe function returns the D^2 score as a float or ndarray of floats. It may be negative and is not well-defined for a single sample. The best possible score is 1.0, and a model that always predicts the per-class proportions of y_true gets a score of 0.0. The function also handles cases where the number of samples is less than two, returning a NaN value in such cases.if _num_samples(y_pred) < 2:\n        msg = \"D^2 score is not well-defined with less than two samples.\"\n        warnings.warn(msg, UndefinedMetricWarning)\n        return float(\"nan\")",
