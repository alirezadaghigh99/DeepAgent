    "result": "To create the `Laplace` function as described, you need to handle different input types and map them to appropriate classes or values.

The function then instantiates and returns the appropriate subclass.\n\nThis implementation assumes that `ParametricLaplace`, `SubsetOfWeights`, and `HessianStructure` are defined elsewhere in your codebase. You may need to adjust the mappings and instantiation logic based on your specific requirements and class definitions.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called Laplace that simplifies Laplace access using strings instead of different classes. The function takes in a torch.nn.Module called model, a Likelihood or string ('classification' or 'regression') called likelihood, a SubsetOfWeights or string ('last_layer', 'subnetwork', 'all') called subset_of_weights with a default value of SubsetOfWeights.LAST_LAYER, and a HessianStructure or string ('diag', 'kron', 'full', 'lowrank') called hessian_structure with a default value of HessianStructure.KRON. \n\nThe function returns a ParametricLaplace object. If subset_of_weights is \"subnetwork\" and hessian_structure is not \"full\" or \"diag\", a ValueError is raised. The function then creates a dictionary mapping subclass keys to subclasses of ParametricLaplace, instantiates the chosen subclass with additional arguments, and returns the instantiated subclass.if subset_of_weights == \"subnetwork\" and hessian_structure not in [\"full\", \"diag\"]:\n        raise ValueError(\n            \"Subnetwork Laplace requires a full or diagonal Hessian approximation!\"\n        )",
