It is particularly useful for functions that can be expressed as a polynomial times a Gaussian.\n- **`numpy.polynomial.hermite.hermgauss`**: This function returns the sample points and weights for Gauss-Hermite quadrature. The points are the roots of the Hermite polynomial, and the weights are used to compute the integral.\n- **TensorFlow Conversion**: The points and weights obtained from NumPy are converted to TensorFlow tensors to be used in TensorFlow-based computations.\n\nThis function will return the points and weights needed to perform the Gauss-Hermite quadrature, which can be used to approximate expectations of functions of normally distributed random variables.",
