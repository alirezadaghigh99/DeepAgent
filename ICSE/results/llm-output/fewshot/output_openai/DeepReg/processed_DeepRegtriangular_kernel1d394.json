    "result": "To complete the `triangular_kernel1d` function, we need to create a 1D triangular kernel. This kernel will have a peak in the center and taper off symmetrically towards the edges. Given that the kernel size is odd, the center of the kernel will be at the middle index. Here's how you can implement this function using TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ndef triangular_kernel1d(kernel_size: int) -> tf.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Return a 1D triangular kernel for LocalNormalizedCrossCorrelation.\n\n    Assume kernel_size is odd, it will be a smoothed from\n    a kernel which center part is zero.\n    Then length of the ones will be around half kernel_size.\n    The weight scale of the kernel does not matter as LNCC will normalize it.\n\n    :param kernel_size: scalar, size of the 1-D kernel\n    :return: kernel_weights, of shape (kernel_size, )\n    \"\"\"\n    assert kernel_size >= 3\n    assert kernel_size % 2 != 0\n\n    # Create a range of values from 0 to kernel_size - 1\n    indices = tf.range(kernel_size, dtype=tf.float32)\n\n    # Calculate the center index\n    center = kernel_size // 2\n\n    # Calculate the triangular values\n    kernel_weights = 1.0 - tf.abs(indices - center) / center\n\n    return kernel_weights\n\n# Example usage\nkernel = triangular_kernel1d(5)\nprint(kernel.numpy())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Indices Calculation**: We create a range of indices from 0 to `kernel_size - 1`.\n- **Center Calculation**: The center of the kernel is calculated as `kernel_size // 2`.\n- **Triangular Values**: The kernel values are calculated using the formula `1.0 - abs(indices - center) / center`, which creates a triangular shape with a peak at the center.\n- **Normalization**: The kernel is inherently normalized by its construction, as the values are scaled between 0 and 1.\n\nThis function will return a 1D tensor representing the triangular kernel, which can be used in various applications, including Local Normalized Cross-Correlation (LNCC).",
