    "result": "To create the `pyramid_combination` function, we need to perform linear interpolation based on the values at the corners of a hypercube in an n-dimensional space. The function will use the provided weights to interpolate between these corner values. Here's how you can implement this function in Python:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef pyramid_combination(\n    values: List[torch.Tensor],\n    weight_floor: List[torch.Tensor],\n    weight_ceil: List[torch.Tensor]\n) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Perform linear interpolation based on values at the corners of a hypercube in an n-dimensional space.\n\n    Args:\n        values (List[Tensor]): List of tensors representing values at the corners of the hypercube.\n        weight_floor (List[Tensor]): List of tensors representing the floor interpolation weights.\n        weight_ceil (List[Tensor]): List of tensors representing the ceil interpolation weights.\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor: A tensor with the same shape as the elements in `values`.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the dimensions of the inputs are incompatible or if the length of `values` is not `2^n`.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(weight_floor)\n    if len(weight_ceil) != n:\n        raise ValueError(\"weight_floor and weight_ceil must have the same length.\")\n    \n    if len(values) != 2 ** n:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Length of values must be 2^n, where n is the length of weight_floor and weight_ceil. Expected {2 ** n}, got {len(values)}.\")\n\n    # Initialize the result tensor with zeros of the same shape as the elements in `values`\n    result = torch.zeros_like(values[0])\n\n    # Iterate over all possible combinations of floor and ceil weights\n    for i in range(2 ** n):\n        # Determine the combination of floor and ceil weights for the current corner\n        current_weight = torch.ones_like(values[0])\n        for j in range(n):\n            if (i >> j) & 1:\n                current_weight *= weight_ceil[j]\n            else:\n                current_weight *= weight_floor[j]\n\n        # Accumulate the weighted value\n        result += current_weight * values[i]\n\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks that the lengths of `weight_floor` and `weight_ceil` are equal and that the length of `values` is `2^n`, where `n` is the length of the weight lists. If these conditions are not met, a `ValueError` is raised.\n\n2. **Initialization**: A result tensor is initialized with zeros, having the same shape as the elements in `values`.\n\n3. **Interpolation**: The function iterates over all possible combinations of floor and ceil weights (using bitwise operations to determine which weights to use for each corner). It calculates the product of the weights for each corner and accumulates the weighted values into the result tensor.\n\n4. **Return**: The function returns the interpolated result tensor.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `pyramid_combination` that performs linear interpolation based on values at the corners of a hypercube in an n-dimensional space. The function accepts three main inputs: `values` (a list of tensors representing values at the corners), `weight_floor`, and `weight_ceil` (lists of tensors representing the interpolation weights). The function ensures that the shapes of the inputs are compatible, with `values` needing to have a length of `2^n` where `n` is the length of `weight_floor` and `weight_ceil`. It returns a tensor with the same shape as the elements in `values`.\n\nThe function includes error handling to check for mismatched dimensions between `values`, `weight_floor`, and `weight_ceil`, and also validates that the length of `values` matches the expected `2^n` based on the dimension of the weights. If these conditions are not met, the function raises a `ValueError`.",
