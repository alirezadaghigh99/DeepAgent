    "result": "To complete the `inverse_transform` function, we need to apply the inverse transformation to the whitened data `x`. This typically involves using a precomputed inverse transformation matrix, which is often stored in an attribute like `self.transform_inv`. Here's how you might complete the function:\n\n```python\ndef inverse_transform(self, x: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n    r\"\"\"Apply the inverse transform to the whitened data.\n\n    Args:\n        x: Whitened data.\n\n    Returns:\n        Original data.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not self.fitted:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Needs to be fitted first before running. Please call fit or set include_fit to True.\")\n\n    if not self.compute_inv:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Did not compute inverse ZCA. Please set compute_inv to True\")\n\n    if self.transform_inv is None:\n        raise TypeError(\"The transform inverse should be a Tensor. Gotcha None.\")\n\n    # Assuming self.mean is the mean used during the whitening process\n    # and self.transform_inv is the inverse transformation matrix\n    if hasattr(self, 'mean'):\n        return torch.matmul(x, self.transform_inv) + self.mean\n    else:\n        return torch.matmul(x, self.transform_inv)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Checks**: The function first checks if the transformation has been fitted and if the inverse transformation matrix has been computed.\n- **Inverse Transformation**: The inverse transformation is applied using matrix multiplication with `self.transform_inv`. If a mean was subtracted during the whitening process, it should be added back to the data to return it to its original space.\n- **Return**: The function returns the original data after applying the inverse transformation.",
