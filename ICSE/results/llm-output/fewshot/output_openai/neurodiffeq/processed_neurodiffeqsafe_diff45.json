If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n- **Shape Matching**: It ensures that `u` and `t` have the same shape, raising a `ValueError` if they do not.\n- **Derivative Calculation**: The function computes the derivative by calculating the difference between consecutive elements in `u` and `t`, then dividing these differences to get the derivative. This process is repeated for the specified `order` of the derivative.\n- **Return**: The function returns the computed derivative as a PyTorch tensor.",
