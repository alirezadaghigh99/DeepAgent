    "result": "To create the `solarize` function as described, you can follow the structure and logic outlined in your request.

If a pixel value is greater than or equal to the threshold, it is replaced with the corresponding inverted value; otherwise, it remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Threshold Check**:\n   - The function checks if the threshold is within the valid range for the image tensor's data type, raising a `TypeError` if it is not.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called solarize that takes in an image tensor (img) and a threshold value (threshold) as input. The function first checks if the input image tensor is valid by calling the _assert_image_tensor function. It then ensures that the image tensor has at least 3 dimensions, raising a TypeError if it does not. The function also checks that the image tensor has either 1 or 3 channels by calling the _assert_channels function.\n\nIf the threshold value is greater than the maximum value of the image tensor's data type, a TypeError is raised. The function then inverts the image tensor using the invert function and returns a new tensor where the values are replaced based on a condition: if the original image tensor values are greater than or equal to the threshold, they are replaced with the corresponding values from the inverted image tensor; otherwise, the original values are retained. The output of the function is a tensor.",
