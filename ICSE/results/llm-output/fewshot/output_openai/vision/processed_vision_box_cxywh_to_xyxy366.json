    "result": "Certainly! Below is a Python function named `_box_cxcywh_to_xyxy` that converts bounding boxes from the (cx, cy, w, h) format to the (x1, y1, x2, y2) format. This function uses PyTorch to handle tensor operations:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _box_cxcywh_to_xyxy(boxes: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert bounding boxes from (cx, cy, w, h) format to (x1, y1, x2, y2) format.\n\n    Args:\n        boxes (Tensor): A tensor of shape (N, 4) where each row represents a bounding box\n                        in the format (cx, cy, w, h).\n\n    Returns:\n        Tensor: A tensor of shape (N, 4) where each row represents a bounding box\n                in the format (x1, y1, x2, y2).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure the input is a tensor\n    if not isinstance(boxes, torch.Tensor):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input boxes should be a torch.Tensor\")\n\n    # Calculate the top-left corner (x1, y1)\n    x1 = boxes[:, 0] - boxes[:, 2] / 2\n    y1 = boxes[:, 1] - boxes[:, 3] / 2\n\n    # Calculate the bottom-right corner (x2, y2)\n    x2 = boxes[:, 0] + boxes[:, 2] / 2\n    y2 = boxes[:, 1] + boxes[:, 3] / 2\n\n    # Stack the results into a single tensor\n    return torch.stack((x1, y1, x2, y2), dim=1)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input**: The function takes a tensor `boxes` of shape (N, 4), where each row represents a bounding box in the (cx, cy, w, h) format.\n- **Output**: It returns a tensor of the same shape (N, 4), where each row is a bounding box in the (x1, y1, x2, y2) format.\n- **Conversion**:\n  - `(x1, y1)` is calculated by subtracting half of the width and height from the center coordinates `(cx, cy)`.\n  - `(x2, y2)` is calculated by adding half of the width and height to the center coordinates `(cx, cy)`.\n- **Stacking**: The results are stacked along the second dimension to form the output tensor.",
    "prompt": "Write a Python function _box_cxcywh_to_xyxy that converts bounding boxes from the (cx, cy, w, h) format, where (cx, cy) represents the center and (w, h) represents the width and height, to the (x1, y1, x2, y2) format, where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) represent the top-left and bottom-right corners, respectively. The function should return a tensor with the converted bounding boxes.",
