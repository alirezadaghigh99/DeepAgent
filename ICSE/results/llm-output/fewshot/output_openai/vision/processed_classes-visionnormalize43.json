    "result": "To implement the `normalize` method for the `GeneralizedRCNNTransform` class, you need to subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation for each channel of the input image. The mean and standard deviation values are provided during the class initialization. Here's how you can implement the `normalize` method:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import nn, Tensor\nfrom typing import List, Optional, Tuple, Dict, Any\n\nclass GeneralizedRCNNTransform(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, min_size: int, max_size: int, image_mean: List[float], image_std: List[float], size_divisible: int = 32, fixed_size: Optional[Tuple[int, int]] = None, **kwargs: Any):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.min_size = min_size\n        self.max_size = max_size\n        self.image_mean = image_mean\n        self.image_std = image_std\n        self.size_divisible = size_divisible\n        self.fixed_size = fixed_size\n        self._skip_resize = kwargs.pop(\"_skip_resize\", False)\n\n    def normalize(self, image: Tensor) -> Tensor:\n        if not image.is_floating_point():\n            raise TypeError(\n                f\"Expected input images to be of floating type (in range [0, 1]), \"\n                f\"but found type {image.dtype} instead\"\n            )\n        \n        # Convert mean and std to tensors\n        mean = torch.tensor(self.image_mean, device=image.device)\n        std = torch.tensor(self.image_std, device=image.device)\n        \n        # Normalize the image\n        image = (image - mean[:, None, None]) / std[:, None, None]\n        \n        return image\n\n    def resize(self, image: Tensor, target: Optional[Dict[str, Tensor]] = None) -> Tuple[Tensor, Optional[Dict[str, Tensor]]]:\n        # Resize the input image and target (if provided) based on the specified size constraints\n        pass\n\n    def batch_images(self, images: List[Tensor], size_divisible: int = 32) -> Tensor:\n        # Batch the list of images into a single tensor, ensuring that all images have the same dimensions\n        pass\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Floating Point Check**: The method first checks if the input image is of a floating-point type, as normalization typically assumes the image values are in the range [0, 1].\n- **Mean and Std Conversion**: The mean and standard deviation lists are converted to tensors to facilitate broadcasting during the normalization process.\n- **Normalization**: The image is normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each channel. The `[:, None, None]` indexing is used to ensure that the mean and standard deviation are applied across the height and width dimensions of the image.\n- **Return**: The method returns the normalized image tensor.",
