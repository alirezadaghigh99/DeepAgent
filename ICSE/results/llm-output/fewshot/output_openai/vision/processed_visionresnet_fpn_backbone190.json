The layers are frozen by setting `requires_grad` to `False`.\n- **Returned Layers**: The function allows specifying which layers to return using the `returned_layers` parameter.\n- **FPN Construction**: The `BackboneWithFPN` class is used to construct the FPN on top of the ResNet backbone. The `in_channels_list` and `out_channels` are set appropriately for the FPN.\n- **Extra Blocks**: If `extra_blocks` is provided, it is used in the FPN construction. Otherwise, the default `LastLevelMaxPool` is used.",
