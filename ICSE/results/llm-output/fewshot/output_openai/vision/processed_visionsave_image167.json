    "result": "To implement the `save_image` function as described, you can follow these steps. This function will handle both single tensors and lists of tensors, convert them to a format suitable for saving as an image, and then use the PIL library to save the image. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport numpy as np\nfrom torchvision.utils import make_grid\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom typing import Union, List, Optional\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\ndef save_image(\n    tensor: Union[torch.Tensor, List[torch.Tensor]],\n    fp: Union[str, Path, 'file-like object'],\n    format: Optional[str] = None,\n    **kwargs\n) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Save a PyTorch tensor or a list of tensors as an image file.\n\n    Args:\n        tensor (Union[torch.Tensor, List[torch.Tensor]]): A single tensor or a list of tensors representing images.\n        fp (Union[str, Path, 'file-like object']): File path or object to save the image.\n        format (str, optional): Image format to use. If not provided, it will be inferred from the file extension.\n        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments for `make_grid`.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(tensor, list):\n        # If a list of tensors is provided, use make_grid to arrange them\n        tensor = make_grid(tensor, **kwargs)\n    \n    # Ensure the tensor is in the correct format\n    if tensor.ndim == 3 and tensor.size(0) in {1, 3}:\n        # Convert single image tensor to a batch of one\n        tensor = tensor.unsqueeze(0)\n    \n    # Normalize and clamp the tensor to the [0, 255] range\n    tensor = tensor.detach().cpu().clamp(0, 1).numpy()\n    tensor = (tensor * 255).astype(np.uint8)\n    \n    # Convert to HWC format for PIL\n    if tensor.ndim == 4:\n        # If batch of images, take the first one\n        tensor = tensor[0]\n    tensor = np.transpose(tensor, (1, 2, 0))  # Convert from CHW to HWC\n    \n    # Convert to PIL Image\n    image = Image.fromarray(tensor)\n    \n    # Save the image\n    image.save(fp, format=format)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts either a single tensor or a list of tensors. If a list is provided, it uses `make_grid` to arrange them into a grid.\n\n2. **Tensor Normalization**: The tensor is clamped to the range [0, 1] and then scaled to [0, 255] to match the typical image pixel range.\n\n3. **Format Conversion**: The tensor is converted from PyTorch's CHW format to the HWC format required by PIL.\n\n4. **Image Saving**: The PIL library is used to save the image. The format is inferred from the file path if not explicitly provided.\n\nThis function should cover the typical use cases for saving images from PyTorch tensors, including handling batches of images and different file formats.",
    "prompt": "Implement a function named `save_image` that saves a PyTorch tensor or a list of tensors as an image file. The function takes the following inputs: `tensor`, which can be either a single PyTorch tensor or a list of tensors representing images; `fp`, which can be a string, `pathlib.Path`, or a file-like object specifying the file path or object to save the image; and an optional `format` string to specify the image format. If no format is provided, it will be inferred from the file extension unless a file object is used, in which case the format must be specified. Additional keyword arguments are passed to `make_grid`, which arranges the tensor into a grid if it represents a mini-batch. The function converts the tensor to a NumPy array after normalizing and clamping it to the [0, 255] range, then saves the resulting image using the PIL library. The function does not return anything (`None`).",
