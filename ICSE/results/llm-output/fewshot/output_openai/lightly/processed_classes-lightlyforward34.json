    "result": "To implement the `forward` function for the `SwaVLoss` class, we need to compute the SwaV loss using the high-resolution and low-resolution outputs. The function should also handle optional queue outputs and calculate the final loss by averaging sublosses across different views.

This is a placeholder and should be implemented according to the specific requirements of the SwaV method.\n\n2. **Iterating Over Outputs**: The `forward` method iterates over the high-resolution outputs and computes the subloss for each pair of high-resolution and low-resolution outputs. If queue outputs are provided, it also computes sublosses for these.\n\n3. **Handling Queue Outputs**: The function checks if `queue_outputs` is provided and computes additional sublosses if so.\n\n4. **Final Loss Calculation**: The final SwaV loss is computed by averaging all the sublosses using `torch.mean`.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the `subloss` method is correctly defined to compute the cross-entropy loss or any other appropriate loss function for the SwaV method.",
