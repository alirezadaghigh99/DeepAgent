    "result": "To implement the `forward` function for the `MMCRLoss` class as described, we need to follow the steps outlined in your request. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass MMCRLoss(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, lmda: float = 5e-3):\n        super().__init__()\n        if lmda < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"lmda must be greater than or equal to 0\")\n\n        self.lmda = lmda\n\n    def forward(self, online: torch.Tensor, momentum: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        # Ensure the online and momentum tensors have the same shape\n        if online.shape != momentum.shape:\n            raise ValueError(\"The 'online' and 'momentum' tensors must have the same shape.\")\n\n        # Concatenate online and momentum along the second dimension\n        concatenated = torch.cat((online, momentum), dim=1)\n\n        # Compute the centroid of the concatenated tensor\n        centroid = concatenated.mean(dim=0, keepdim=True)\n\n        # Calculate the singular values of the concatenated tensor and the centroid\n        _, singular_values_concat, _ = torch.svd(concatenated)\n        _, singular_values_centroid, _ = torch.svd(centroid)\n\n        # Compute the loss\n        batch_size = concatenated.size(0)\n        loss = -singular_values_centroid.sum() + self.lmda * singular_values_concat.sum() / batch_size\n\n        return loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Shape Check**: The function first checks if the `online` and `momentum` tensors have the same shape. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Concatenation**: The `online` and `momentum` tensors are concatenated along the second dimension using `torch.cat`.\n\n3. **Centroid Calculation**: The centroid of the concatenated tensor is computed by taking the mean along the batch dimension (dimension 0).\n\n4. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: The singular values of both the concatenated tensor and the centroid are calculated using `torch.svd`.\n\n5. **Loss Calculation**: The loss is computed as the negative sum of the singular values of the centroid plus the weighted sum of the singular values of the concatenated tensor, divided by the batch size. The weight is given by the `lmda` parameter.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the input tensors are suitable for SVD and that the operations are differentiable, which is typically the case in PyTorch.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `forward` for the class `MMCRLoss` that computes the loss using Manifold Capacity Representations. The function should:\n\n1. Ensure the `online` and `momentum` tensors have the same shape.\n2. Concatenate `online` and `momentum` along the second dimension.\n3. Compute the centroid of the concatenated tensor.\n4.
