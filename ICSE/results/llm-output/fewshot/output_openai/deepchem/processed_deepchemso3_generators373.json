The dimension of the matrices is `(2k+1) x (2k+1)`.\n- **SU(2) Generators**: The function constructs the SU(2) generators \\( J_x \\), \\( J_y \\), and \\( J_z \\) using the standard angular momentum operator definitions.\n- **SO(3 Generators)**: The function returns a stack of these generators, which can be used to represent rotations in three-dimensional space.\n- **Error Handling**: The function checks if `k` is a positive integer and raises a `ValueError` if not.\n\nThis function is useful in physics and engineering applications where understanding and manipulating 3D rotations is necessary.",
