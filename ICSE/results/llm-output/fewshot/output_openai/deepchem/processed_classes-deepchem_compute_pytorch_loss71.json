    "result": "Certainly! Below is a Python function `_create_pytorch_loss` for the class `L2Loss` that creates a PyTorch loss function to calculate the mean squared error (MSE) loss. This function ensures that the shapes of `output` and `labels` are consistent and computes the MSE loss without reduction.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass L2Loss(nn.Module):\n    def _create_pytorch_loss(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Creates a PyTorch loss function to calculate the mean squared error (MSE) loss.\n        \n        Ensures the shapes of `output` and `labels` are consistent, then computes the MSE loss\n        without reduction.\n        \n        Returns:\n            A function that takes `output` and `labels` as inputs and returns the MSE loss.\n        \"\"\"\n        def mse_loss(output: torch.Tensor, labels: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n            if output.shape != labels.shape:\n                raise ValueError(\"Shape of output and labels must be the same.\")\n            \n            # Compute the mean squared error without reduction\n            loss = (output - labels) ** 2\n            return loss\n        \n        return mse_loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Class Definition**: The `L2Loss` class inherits from `nn.Module`, which is a base class for all neural network modules in PyTorch.\n- **Function `_create_pytorch_loss`**: This function defines and returns a nested function `mse_loss`.\n- **Shape Consistency Check**: Before computing the loss, the function checks if the shapes of `output` and `labels` are the same. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n- **MSE Loss Calculation**: The mean squared error is calculated as the element-wise square of the difference between `output` and `labels`. The loss is returned without any reduction (i.e., not averaged or summed).",
