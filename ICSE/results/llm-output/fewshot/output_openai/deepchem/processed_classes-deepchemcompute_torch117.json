    "result": "To implement the `_compute_pytorch_loss` function for calculating the softmax cross-entropy loss using PyTorch, you can use the `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy` function. This function is well-suited for handling both 2D and 3D input shapes, as it can automatically apply the softmax operation and compute the loss. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom torch.nn import Loss\n\nclass SoftmaxCrossEntropy(Loss):\n    def _compute_pytorch_loss(self, output, labels):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the softmax cross-entropy loss between output logits and labels.\n\n        Args:\n            output (Tensor): Logits tensor of shape (batch_size, classes) or (batch_size, tasks, classes).\n            labels (Tensor): Labels tensor of shape (batch_size,) or (batch_size, tasks).\n\n        Returns:\n            Tensor: Loss value(s) as a tensor.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Check if the output is 3D (i.e., has tasks dimension)\n        if output.dim() == 3:\n            # Reshape output and labels to 2D for cross-entropy computation\n            batch_size, tasks, classes = output.shape\n            output = output.view(batch_size * tasks, classes)\n            labels = labels.view(batch_size * tasks)\n\n        # Compute the cross-entropy loss\n        loss = F.cross_entropy(output, labels)\n\n        return loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Shapes**: The function handles both 2D and 3D input shapes. If the input is 3D, it reshapes the tensors to 2D by combining the batch and task dimensions, which allows the use of `F.cross_entropy`.\n- **Cross-Entropy Loss**: The `F.cross_entropy` function computes the softmax operation internally and calculates the loss, making it efficient and straightforward to use.\n- **Output**: The function returns the computed loss as a tensor. If the input was 3D, the loss is computed over the combined batch and task dimensions.",
