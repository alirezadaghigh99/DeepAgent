    "result": "To implement the `_compute_tf_loss` function for calculating the sigmoid cross-entropy loss using TensorFlow, you can use the `tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits` function. This function is designed to compute the sigmoid cross-entropy loss between logits and labels, which is a common loss function for binary classification tasks. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.losses import Loss\n\nclass SigmoidCrossEntropy(Loss):\n    def _compute_tf_loss(self, output, labels):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the sigmoid cross-entropy loss between output logits and labels.\n\n        Args:\n            output (tf.Tensor): Logits tensor of shape (batch_size,) or (batch_size, tasks).\n            labels (tf.Tensor): Labels tensor of the same shape as output.\n\n        Returns:\n            tf.Tensor: Tensor of loss values.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Ensure the labels are of the same dtype as the output\n        labels = tf.cast(labels, dtype=output.dtype)\n        \n        # Compute the sigmoid cross-entropy loss\n        loss = tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=output)\n        \n        # Return the mean loss over the batch\n        return tf.reduce_mean(loss)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Imports**: We import TensorFlow and the `Loss` class from `tensorflow.keras.losses`.\n- **Class Definition**: We define a class `SigmoidCrossEntropy` that inherits from `Loss`.\n- **Method `_compute_tf_loss`**:\n  - **Arguments**: It takes `output` (logits) and `labels` as inputs.\n  - **Casting**: The labels are cast to the same data type as the output to ensure compatibility.\n  - **Loss Calculation**: We use `tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits` to compute the loss. This function expects logits and labels of the same shape.\n  - **Return**: The function returns the mean of the computed loss values across the batch using `tf.reduce_mean`.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the `output` and `labels` tensors are already prepared and have compatible shapes. The function computes the loss for each element in the batch and then averages these losses to return a single scalar value representing the mean loss.",
