    "result": "To create a Python function `unsorted_segment_sum` that computes the sum along segments of a tensor, similar to TensorFlow's `tf.unsorted_segment_sum`, you can use the following implementation. This function will take a tensor, segment IDs, and the number of segments as inputs and return a tensor with the sum of each segment.\n\nHere's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef unsorted_segment_sum(data: torch.Tensor, segment_ids: torch.Tensor, num_segments: int) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the sum along segments of a tensor.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    data : torch.Tensor\n        The input tensor to be segmented.\n    segment_ids : torch.Tensor\n        A 1-D tensor with the same size as the first dimension of `data`, containing the segment IDs.\n    num_segments : int\n        The number of distinct segment IDs.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    torch.Tensor\n        A tensor with the sum of each segment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the output tensor with zeros\n    output_shape = (num_segments,) + data.shape[1:]\n    output = torch.zeros(output_shape, dtype=data.dtype, device=data.device)\n\n    # Iterate over each segment ID and accumulate the sum\n    for i in range(num_segments):\n        mask = segment_ids == i\n        output[i] = data[mask].sum(dim=0)\n\n    return output\n\n# Example usage\ndata = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]])\nsegment_ids = torch.tensor([0, 1, 0, 1])\nnum_segments = 2\n\nresult = unsorted_segment_sum(data, segment_ids, num_segments)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Parameters:**\n  - `data`: The input tensor that you want to segment and sum.\n  - `segment_ids`: A 1-D tensor that specifies the segment ID for each element in the first dimension of `data`.\n  - `num_segments`: The total number of unique segment IDs.\n\n- **Implementation:**\n  - The function initializes an output tensor with zeros, having a shape that accommodates the number of segments and the remaining dimensions of `data`.\n  - It iterates over each segment ID, creates a mask to select elements belonging to the current segment, and computes the sum of these elements.\n  - The result is stored in the corresponding position in the output tensor.\n\nThis function is a straightforward implementation and may not be the most efficient for very large tensors, but it demonstrates the basic concept of unsorted segment summation.",
