    "result": "To create a Python function called `_create_pytorch_loss` that calculates the sigmoid cross-entropy loss between output logits and labels using PyTorch, you can define the function as follows. This function will handle both binary and multi-task scenarios, where the input tensors can have shapes `(batch_size)` or `(batch_size, tasks)`.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom torch.nn import Module\n\nclass SigmoidCrossEntropy(Module):\n    def _create_pytorch_loss(self, logits: torch.Tensor, labels: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the sigmoid cross-entropy loss between logits and labels.\n\n        Args:\n            logits (Tensor): Tensor of shape (batch_size) or (batch_size, tasks) containing the output logits.\n            labels (Tensor): Tensor of the same shape as logits containing the target labels.\n\n        Returns:\n            loss (Tensor): Tensor containing the loss values.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Ensure logits and labels have the same shape\n        if logits.shape != labels.shape:\n            raise ValueError(\"Logits and labels must have the same shape.\")\n\n        # Calculate the sigmoid cross-entropy loss\n        loss = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits, labels, reduction='none')\n\n        return loss\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Imports**: The function uses `torch` and `torch.nn.functional` for PyTorch operations and loss calculations.\n- **Class Definition**: The `SigmoidCrossEntropy` class inherits from `torch.nn.Module`, which is a common practice for defining custom loss functions in PyTorch.\n- **Function Definition**: The `_create_pytorch_loss` function takes `logits` and `labels` as inputs, both of which are expected to be PyTorch tensors.\n- **Shape Check**: The function checks if the shapes of `logits` and `labels` match, raising a `ValueError` if they do not.\n- **Loss Calculation**: The function uses `F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits`, which combines a sigmoid layer and the binary cross-entropy loss in a single function. This is numerically more stable than using a plain sigmoid followed by a binary cross-entropy loss.\n- **Return**: The function returns the calculated loss tensor, with `reduction='none'` to return the loss for each element in the batch.",
