    "result": "To implement the `update_delta_decay_factor` function for the `DDPG` class, we need to follow the specified behavior for different ranges of training episodes. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nclass DDPG:\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.delta_decay = None  # Initialize the delta decay factor\n        pass\n\n    def update_delta_decay_factor(self, num_train_episode):\n        # Ensure the number of training episodes is positive\n        assert num_train_episode > 0, \"Number of training episodes must be greater than zero.\"\n\n        # Update delta decay factor based on the number of training episodes\n        if num_train_episode < 1000:\n            # Specific calibrated values for episodes below 1000\n            self.delta_decay = 0.1  # Example value, adjust as needed\n        elif 1000 <= num_train_episode <= 3000:\n            # Linear interpolation for episodes between 1000 and 3000\n            # Example: interpolate between 0.1 and 0.01\n            self.delta_decay = 0.1 - (0.1 - 0.01) * ((num_train_episode - 1000) / 2000)\n        else:\n            # Constant decay factor for episodes beyond 3000\n            self.delta_decay = 0.01  # Example value, adjust as needed\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Assertion**: The function starts by asserting that the number of training episodes is greater than zero. This ensures that the function is used correctly.\n\n2. **Calibrated Values for Episodes < 1000**: For episodes below 1000, a specific calibrated value is set for `self.delta_decay`. In this example, I've used `0.1` as a placeholder. You should replace it with the actual calibrated value you intend to use.\n\n3. **Linear Interpolation for Episodes 1000 to 3000**: For episodes between 1000 and 3000, the function uses linear interpolation to adjust the decay factor. The example interpolates between `0.1` and `0.01`, but you can adjust these values based on your specific requirements.\n\n4. **Constant Decay Factor for Episodes > 3000**: For episodes beyond 3000, the decay factor is set to a constant value. In this example, it's `0.01`, but you should replace it with the desired constant value.\n\nThis implementation provides a flexible way to adjust the delta decay factor based on the number of training episodes, following the specified rules.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `update_delta_decay_factor` for the class `DDPG` that updates the delta decay factor based on the number of training episodes. The function adjusts the decay factor according to specific calibrated values for episodes below 1000, a linear interpolation for episodes between 1000 and 3000, and sets a constant decay factor for episodes beyond 3000. The function raises an assertion error if the number of training episodes is less than or equal to zero.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass DDPG:\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.delta_decay = None  # Initialize the delta decay factor\n        pass\n\n    def update_delta_decay_factor(self, num_train_episode):\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
