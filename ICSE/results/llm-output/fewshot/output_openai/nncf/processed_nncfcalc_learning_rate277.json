    "result": "To implement the `calc_learning_rate` function as described, you can follow the instructions to handle different learning rate schedules. Here's how you can implement the function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calc_learning_rate(\n    current_epoch: int,\n    initial_lr: float,\n    total_epochs: int,\n    current_batch: int,\n    total_batches_per_epoch: int,\n    lr_schedule_type: str = \"cosine\"\n) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the learning rate based on the provided schedule type.\n\n    Args:\n        current_epoch (int): The current epoch number.\n        initial_lr (float): The initial learning rate.\n        total_epochs (int): The total number of epochs.\n        current_batch (int): The current batch number within the epoch.\n        total_batches_per_epoch (int): The total number of batches per epoch.\n        lr_schedule_type (str): The learning rate schedule type. Defaults to \"cosine\".\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The calculated learning rate.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If an unsupported schedule type is provided.\n    \"\"\"\n    if lr_schedule_type == \"cosine\":\n        # Calculate the total number of iterations\n        total_iterations = total_epochs * total_batches_per_epoch\n        # Calculate the current iteration\n        current_iteration = current_epoch * total_batches_per_epoch + current_batch\n        # Calculate the cosine annealing learning rate\n        lr = initial_lr * 0.5 * (1 + math.cos(math.pi * current_iteration / total_iterations))\n    elif lr_schedule_type == \"\":\n        # If no schedule type is provided, return the initial learning rate\n        lr = initial_lr\n    else:\n        # Raise an error for unsupported schedule types\n        raise ValueError(\"do not support: %s\" % lr_schedule_type)\n\n    return lr\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Cosine Annealing Schedule**: This schedule gradually reduces the learning rate following a cosine curve. The formula used is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{lr} = \\text{initial\\_lr} \\times 0.5 \\times \\left(1 + \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi \\times \\text{current\\_iteration}}{\\text{total\\_iterations}}\\right)\\right)\n  \\]\n  where `current_iteration` is calculated as the sum of the completed epochs and the current batch within the current epoch.\n\n- **Default Schedule**: If no schedule type is provided, the function returns the initial learning rate.\n\n- **Error Handling**: If an unsupported schedule type is provided, the function raises a `ValueError`.\n\nThis implementation allows you to easily extend the function to support additional learning rate schedules in the future.",
    "prompt": "You need to implement a function called `calc_learning_rate` that calculates the learning rate during training based on the provided schedule type. The function takes inputs for the current epoch, initial learning rate, total epochs, current batch, total batches per epoch, and the learning rate schedule type, which defaults to \"cosine.\" If \"cosine\" is selected, the learning rate should be calculated using a cosine annealing schedule; otherwise, if no schedule type is provided, return the initial learning rate. If an unsupported schedule type is given, raise ValueError(\"do not support: %s\" % lr_schedule_type) The function outputs the calculated learning rate as a float.",
