    "result": "To implement the `save_model` function for the `DDPG` class, you need to save the state dictionaries of the actor and critic networks to the specified output directory. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport torch\n\nclass DDPG:\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.actor = None  # actor network\n        self.critic = None  # critic network\n        pass\n\n    def save_model(self, output):\n        \"\"\"\n        Saves the weights of the actor and critic networks to the specified output directory.\n\n        Args:\n            output (str): The directory where the model weights will be saved.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Ensure the output directory exists\n        os.makedirs(output, exist_ok=True)\n\n        # Save the actor's state dictionary\n        actor_path = os.path.join(output, 'actor.pkl')\n        torch.save(self.actor.state_dict(), actor_path)\n\n        # Save the critic's state dictionary\n        critic_path = os.path.join(output, 'critic.pkl')\n        torch.save(self.critic.state_dict(), critic_path)\n\n        print(f\"Actor and critic models have been saved to {output}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Directory Creation**: The `os.makedirs(output, exist_ok=True)` line ensures that the specified output directory exists. If it doesn't, it will be created.\n\n2. **Saving State Dictionaries**: \n   - The actor's state dictionary is saved to a file named `actor.pkl` in the output directory.\n   - The critic's state dictionary is saved to a file named `critic.pkl` in the output directory.\n   - `torch.save` is used to save the state dictionaries, which is the standard method for saving PyTorch model weights.\n\n3. **Feedback**: A print statement is included to confirm that the models have been saved successfully. This can be helpful for debugging and ensuring that the function executed as expected.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function `save_model` for the class `DDPG` that saves the weights of the actor and critic networks to a specified output directory. The function should save the actor's state dictionary as `actor.pkl` and the critic's state dictionary as `critic.pkl` within the given output directory.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass DDPG:\n    def __init__(self, nb_states, nb_actions, iter_number: int = None, hparam_override: dict = None):\n        self.actor = None  # actor network\n        self.critic = None  # critic network\n        pass\n\n    def save_model(self, output):\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```\n\nThis function will save the model's actor and critic networks' weights to the specified output directory, ensuring that the models can be reloaded later.",
