    "result": "To create a function called `create_nncf_network` that prepares a PyTorch model for compression using NNCF (Neural Network Compression Framework), you need to integrate the NNCF library's capabilities with your model and configuration. Below is a Python function that outlines how you might implement this:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom nncf import NNCFConfig\nfrom nncf.torch import create_compressed_model, NNCFNetwork\n\ndef create_nncf_network(model: torch.nn.Module,\n                        config: NNCFConfig,\n                        dummy_forward_fn: Optional[callable] = None,\n                        wrap_inputs_fn: Optional[callable] = None,\n                        wrap_outputs_fn: Optional[callable] = None) -> NNCFNetwork:\n    \"\"\"\n    Prepares a PyTorch model for compression using NNCF.\n\n    :param model: The original model with parameters loaded.\n    :param config: Configuration object for compression.\n    :param dummy_forward_fn: Optional function for custom forward pass during graph tracing.\n    :param wrap_inputs_fn: Optional function to wrap model inputs for compression.\n    :param wrap_outputs_fn: Optional function to wrap model outputs for compression.\n    :return: A model wrapped by NNCFNetwork, ready for compression.\n    \"\"\"\n    if dummy_forward_fn is not None and wrap_inputs_fn is None:\n        raise ValueError(\"wrap_inputs_fn must be specified if dummy_forward_fn is specified.\")\n\n    # Wrap the model with NNCF\n    nncf_model, compression_ctrl = create_compressed_model(\n        model,\n        config,\n        dummy_forward_fn=dummy_forward_fn,\n        wrap_inputs_fn=wrap_inputs_fn,\n        wrap_outputs_fn=wrap_outputs_fn\n    )\n\n    return nncf_model\n\n# Example usage:\n# model = ...  # Your PyTorch model\n# config = NNCFConfig.from_json(\"path_to_config.json\")\n# nncf_model = create_nncf_network(model, config)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Imports**: The function imports necessary modules from PyTorch and NNCF.\n\n2. **Function Definition**: The `create_nncf_network` function takes several parameters:\n   - `model`: The PyTorch model to be compressed.\n   - `config`: An NNCF configuration object that specifies how the model should be compressed.\n   - `dummy_forward_fn`: An optional function for a custom forward pass during graph tracing.\n   - `wrap_inputs_fn`: An optional function to wrap model inputs for compression.\n   - `wrap_outputs_fn`: An optional function to wrap model outputs for compression.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: If `dummy_forward_fn` is provided, `wrap_inputs_fn` must also be provided. This ensures that the inputs are correctly wrapped for tracing.\n\n4. **Model Wrapping**: The function uses `create_compressed_model` from NNCF to wrap the model, making it ready for compression. This function returns the wrapped model and a compression controller, but only the model is returned in this implementation.\n\n5. **Return**: The function returns the NNCF-wrapped model, which is ready for further compression steps.\n\nThis function provides a flexible way to prepare a model for compression, allowing for custom input and output handling if needed.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called create_nncf_network that The main function used to produce a model ready for adding compression from an original PyTorch\n    model and a configuration object.\n\n    :param model: The original model. Should have its parameters already loaded from a checkpoint or another\n        source.\n    :param config: A configuration object used to determine the exact compression modifications to be applied\n        to the model\n    :param dummy_forward_fn: if supplied, will be used instead of a *forward* function call to build\n        the internal graph representation via tracing. Specifying this is useful when the original training pipeline\n        has special formats of data loader output or has additional *forward* arguments other than input tensors.\n        Otherwise, the *forward* call of the model during graph tracing will be made with mock tensors according\n        to the shape specified in the config object. The dummy_forward_fn code MUST contain calls to\n        nncf.nncf_model_input\n        functions made with each compressed model input tensor in the underlying model's args/kwargs tuple, and these\n        calls should be exactly the same as in the wrap_inputs_fn function code (see below); if dummy_forward_fn is\n        specified, then wrap_inputs_fn also must be specified.\n    :param wrap_inputs_fn: if supplied, will be used on the module's input arguments during a regular, non-dummy\n        forward call before passing the inputs to the underlying compressed model. This is required if the model's input\n        tensors that are important for compression are not supplied as arguments to the model's forward call directly,\n        but instead are located in a container (such as list), and the model receives the container as an argument.\n        wrap_inputs_fn should take as input two arguments - the tuple of positional arguments to the underlying\n        model's forward call, and a dict of keyword arguments to the same. The function should wrap each tensor among\n        the supplied model's args and kwargs that is important for compression (e.g. quantization) with an\n        nncf.nncf_model_input function, which is a no-operation function and marks the tensors as inputs to be traced\n        by NNCF in the internal graph representation. Output is the tuple of (args, kwargs), where args and kwargs are\n        the same as were supplied in input, but each tensor in the original input. Must be specified if\n        dummy_forward_fn is specified.\n    :param wrap_outputs_fn: Same as `wrap_inputs_fn`, but for marking model outputs with\n\n    :return: A model wrapped by NNCFNetwork, which is ready for adding compression.\"\"\"",
