    "result": "Certainly! Below is a Python function called `frequencies_to_period` that calculates the period of a Fourier series based on a set of frequencies. The function includes a docstring with an example usage:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef frequencies_to_period(frequencies, decimals=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the period of a Fourier series based on a set of frequencies.\n\n    The period is calculated as 2\u03c0 / gcd(frequencies), where gcd is the greatest\n    common divisor of the frequencies. If the frequencies are not integers, they\n    are rounded to the specified number of decimal places before calculating the period.\n\n    Args:\n        frequencies (tuple): A tuple of frequencies.\n        decimals (int, optional): The number of decimal places to round to. Defaults to 5.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The period of the Fourier series.\n\n    Example:\n        frequencies = (0.5, 1.0)\n        period = frequencies_to_period(frequencies)\n        print(period)  # Output: 12.566370614359172\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Calculate the greatest common divisor of the frequencies\n        gcd = np.gcd.reduce(frequencies)\n    except TypeError:\n        # If frequencies are not integers, round them to the specified decimals\n        exponent = 10 ** decimals\n        rounded = np.round(frequencies, decimals) * exponent\n        gcd = np.gcd.reduce(np.int64(rounded)) / exponent\n\n    # Calculate the period as 2\u03c0 / gcd\n    period = 2 * np.pi / gcd\n    return period\n\n# Example usage\nfrequencies = (0.5, 1.0)\nperiod = frequencies_to_period(frequencies)\nprint(period)  # Output: 12.566370614359172\n```\n\nThis function uses NumPy to handle the calculation of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and to perform rounding operations. If the frequencies are not integers, they are rounded to the specified number of decimal places before computing the GCD. The period is then calculated as \\(2\\pi/\\text{gcd}\\).",
