    "result": "Certainly! The function `_coefficients_no_filter` is designed to compute the Fourier coefficients of a \\(2\\pi\\)-periodic function. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef _coefficients_no_filter(f, degree, use_broadcasting):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the first (2d+1) Fourier coefficients of a 2\u03c0-periodic function.\n\n    Args:\n        f (callable): The 2\u03c0-periodic function to compute coefficients for.\n        degree (int or tuple): The maximum frequency degree in each dimension.\n        use_broadcasting (bool): Whether to use broadcasting for function evaluations.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: Array of complex numbers containing the Fourier coefficients.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure degree is a tuple for consistent handling\n    degree = np.atleast_1d(degree)\n    k = 2 * degree + 1  # Number of terms in each dimension\n\n    # Create ranges for each dimension\n    n_ranges = [np.arange(-d, d + 1) for d in degree]\n    # Create a product of ranges for multi-dimensional evaluation\n    nvecs = product(*(n_ranges[:-1] if use_broadcasting else n_ranges))\n    # Initialize an array to store function evaluations\n    f_discrete = np.zeros(shape=tuple(k), dtype=complex)\n    # Calculate spacing for sampling points\n    spacing = (2 * np.pi) / k\n\n    for nvec in nvecs:\n        # Handle broadcasting by appending the last dimension's range as an array\n        if use_broadcasting:\n            nvec = (*nvec, n_ranges[-1])  # n_ranges[-1] is an array\n            sampling_point = [s * n for s, n in zip(spacing, nvec)]\n        else:\n            sampling_point = spacing * np.array(nvec)\n\n        # Evaluate the function at the sampling point and store the result\n        f_discrete[nvec] = f(sampling_point)\n\n    # Compute the Fourier coefficients using the FFT\n    coeffs = np.fft.fftn(f_discrete) / f_discrete.size\n\n    return coeffs\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Inputs:**\n   - `f`: A callable function that is \\(2\\pi\\)-periodic.\n   - `degree`: An integer or tuple specifying the maximum frequency degree in each dimension.\n   - `use_broadcasting`: A boolean indicating whether to use broadcasting for simultaneous evaluations.\n\n2. **Process:**\n   - Convert `degree` to a tuple to handle multi-dimensional cases.\n   - Calculate the number of terms (`k`) in each dimension.\n   - Create ranges for each dimension and generate combinations of these ranges.\n   - Initialize an array `f_discrete` to store function evaluations.\n   - Calculate the spacing for sampling points.\n   - Evaluate the function `f` at each sampling point and store the results.\n   - Use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to compute the Fourier coefficients.\n\n3. **Output:**\n   - Returns a NumPy array of complex numbers representing the Fourier coefficients.\n\nThis function efficiently handles multi-dimensional inputs and leverages broadcasting for performance optimization when specified.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function `_coefficients_no_filter` that computes the first \\(2d+1\\) Fourier coefficients for a \\(2\\pi\\)-periodic function, serving as a helper to compute these coefficients without filtering. The function takes a callable `f`, an integer or tuple `degree` representing the maximum frequency, and a boolean `use_broadcasting` to decide whether to use broadcasting for simultaneous function evaluations. It returns a NumPy array of complex numbers containing the Fourier coefficients up to the specified degree. The function should efficiently handle multi-dimensional inputs and leverage broadcasting for performance optimization.",
