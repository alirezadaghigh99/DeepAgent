If they are, it converts them to NumPy arrays using the `.numpy()` method.\n- **Element-wise Comparison**: It then performs an element-wise comparison using `tensor1 == tensor2`.\n- **Logical AND Reduction**: The result of the comparison is passed to `np.all`, which applies a logical AND reduction across the specified axis or the entire array if no axis is specified. The `**kwargs` allows for additional arguments like `axis`, `out`, and `keepdims` to be passed to `np.all`.\n- **Return Value**: The function returns a boolean or a boolean array, depending on whether an axis is specified.",
