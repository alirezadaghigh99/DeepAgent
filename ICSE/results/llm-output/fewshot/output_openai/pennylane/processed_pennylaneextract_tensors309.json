    "result": "To create a function called `extract_tensors` that iterates through an iterable and extracts any PennyLane tensors, you can follow the structure of the examples provided. Here's how you might implement such a function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Sequence, Generator, Union\nimport pennylane as qml\n\ndef extract_tensors(x: Union[qml.numpy.tensor, Sequence]) -> Generator[qml.numpy.tensor, None, None]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Iterate through an iterable, and extract any PennyLane tensors that appear.\n\n    Args:\n        x (qml.numpy.tensor or Sequence): an input tensor or sequence\n\n    Yields:\n        qml.numpy.tensor: the next tensor in the sequence. If the input was a single\n        tensor, then the tensor is yielded and the iterator completes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(x, qml.numpy.tensor):\n        yield x\n    elif isinstance(x, Sequence):\n        for item in x:\n            if isinstance(item, qml.numpy.tensor):\n                yield item\n            elif isinstance(item, Sequence):\n                yield from extract_tensors(item)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Type Annotations**: The function uses type annotations to specify that the input `x` can be either a `qml.numpy.tensor` or a `Sequence`. The function returns a generator that yields `qml.numpy.tensor` objects.\n\n2. **Single Tensor Handling**: If the input `x` is a single PennyLane tensor, it is yielded immediately.\n\n3. **Sequence Handling**: If the input is a sequence, the function iterates over each item. If an item is a PennyLane tensor, it is yielded. If an item is itself a sequence, the function recursively calls `extract_tensors` to handle nested sequences.\n\n4. **Recursion**: The use of `yield from` allows the function to handle nested sequences by recursively calling itself, ensuring that all tensors within the nested structure are extracted.\n\nThis function is designed to be flexible and handle both single tensors and complex nested sequences, extracting all PennyLane tensors it encounters.",
