    "result": "Certainly! Below is a Python function called `cast_like` that takes in two parameters, `tensor1` and `tensor2`, and casts `tensor1` to the same data type as `tensor2`. The function also handles cases where the inputs can be lists or tuples by converting them to tensors first.\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef cast_like(tensor1, tensor2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Casts tensor1 to the same data type as tensor2.\n\n    Args:\n        tensor1: A tensor, list, or tuple to be cast.\n        tensor2: A tensor, list, or tuple whose data type will be used for casting.\n\n    Returns:\n        A tensor with the same data type as tensor2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert lists or tuples to tensors\n    if isinstance(tensor1, (list, tuple)):\n        tensor1 = torch.tensor(tensor1)\n    if isinstance(tensor2, (list, tuple)):\n        tensor2 = torch.tensor(tensor2)\n\n    # Cast tensor1 to the same dtype as tensor2\n    return tensor1.to(tensor2.dtype)\n\n# Example usage:\n# tensor1 = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\n# tensor2 = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3], dtype=torch.int32)\n# result = cast_like(tensor1, tensor2)\n# print(result)  # Output: tensor([1, 2, 3], dtype=torch.int32)\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the inputs are lists or tuples and converts them to PyTorch tensors. It then uses the `to` method to cast `tensor1` to the data type of `tensor2`. This approach ensures that the function can handle different input types and perform the casting operation correctly.",
