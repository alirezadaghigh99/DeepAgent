    "result": "To create the `acos_linear_extrapolation` function, we need to handle the computation of the arccosine for values within the domain \\((-1, 1)\\) and apply linear extrapolation for values outside this domain. We'll also include error handling to ensure the bounds are valid. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\ndef acos_linear_extrapolation(x: torch.Tensor, bounds: Tuple[float, float]) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the arccosine of a tensor with linear extrapolation outside the domain (-1, 1).\n\n    Args:\n        x (torch.Tensor): The input tensor for which to compute the arccosine.\n        bounds (Tuple[float, float]): A tuple containing the lower and upper bounds for the linear extrapolation.\n\n    Returns:\n        torch.Tensor: A tensor containing the extrapolated arccos(x) values.\n\n    Raises:\n        ValueError: If the bounds are outside the range (-1, 1) or if the lower bound is greater than the upper bound.\n    \"\"\"\n    lower_bound, upper_bound = bounds\n\n    # Validate bounds\n    if not (-1 < lower_bound < 1) or not (-1 < upper_bound < 1):\n        raise ValueError(\"Bounds must be within the range (-1, 1).\")\n    if lower_bound > upper_bound:\n        raise ValueError(\"Lower bound must be less than or equal to the upper bound.\")\n\n    # Compute arccosine for values within the domain\n    acos_values = torch.acos(torch.clamp(x, -1, 1))\n\n    # Apply linear extrapolation for values outside the bounds\n    # First-order Taylor approximation: acos(x) \u2248 \u03c0/2 - x for x near 0\n    extrapolation_slope = -1.0  # Derivative of acos(x) at x=0 is -1\n\n    # Create masks for extrapolation\n    lower_mask = x < lower_bound\n    upper_mask = x > upper_bound\n\n    # Apply linear extrapolation\n    acos_values[lower_mask] = (torch.acos(torch.tensor(lower_bound)) +\n                               extrapolation_slope * (x[lower_mask] - lower_bound))\n    acos_values[upper_mask] = (torch.acos(torch.tensor(upper_bound)) +\n                               extrapolation_slope * (x[upper_mask] - upper_bound))\n\n    return acos_values\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the provided bounds are within the valid range \\((-1, 1)\\) and if the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n2. **Arccosine Calculation**: For values within the domain \\([-1, 1]\\), the standard `torch.acos` function is used. The `torch.clamp` function ensures that values are within this range before applying `torch.acos`.\n\n3. **Linear Extrapolation**: For values outside the specified bounds, a linear extrapolation is applied using a first-order Taylor approximation. The derivative of `acos(x)` at \\(x=0\\) is \\(-1\\), which is used as the slope for extrapolation.\n\n4. **Masking**: Masks are created to identify values that need extrapolation, and the extrapolation is applied accordingly.\n\nThis function should handle the computation of arccosine with linear extrapolation effectively, ensuring stable backpropagation for values outside the domain.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function named acos_linear_extrapolation that computes the arccosine of a tensor, with linear extrapolation applied outside the domain \n(\n\u2212\n1\n,\n1\n)\n(\u22121,1) for stable backpropagation. The function should take a tensor x and a tuple bounds representing the lower and upper bounds for the extrapolation region. If the value of x is within the bounds, the function should return the standard arccos(x) value. If x is outside the bounds, it should apply a first-order Taylor approximation for extrapolation. The function should validate that the bounds are within the valid range \n(\n\u2212\n1\n,\n1\n)\n(\u22121,1) and that the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound.
