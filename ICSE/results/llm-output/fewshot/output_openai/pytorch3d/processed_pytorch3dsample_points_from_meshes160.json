    "result": "To implement the `sample_points_from_meshes` function, you can use the PyTorch3D library, which provides utilities for working with 3D data, including meshes and point clouds. The function will sample points from the surface of each mesh in the batch, with the probability of sampling from a face proportional to its area. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom pytorch3d.structures import Meshes\nfrom pytorch3d.ops import sample_points_from_meshes as pytorch3d_sample_points\n\ndef sample_points_from_meshes(\n    meshes: Meshes,\n    num_samples: int,\n    return_normals: bool = False,\n    return_textures: bool = False\n) -> Tuple[torch.FloatTensor, Optional[torch.FloatTensor], Optional[torch.FloatTensor]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert a batch of meshes to a batch of point clouds by uniformly sampling points\n    on the surface of the mesh with probability proportional to the face area.\n\n    Args:\n        meshes (Meshes): A Meshes object with a batch of N meshes.\n        num_samples (int): Number of point samples per mesh.\n        return_normals (bool): Whether to return normals for the sampled points.\n        return_textures (bool): Whether to return textures for the sampled points.\n\n    Returns:\n        samples (FloatTensor): Tensor of shape (N, num_samples, 3) with sampled point coordinates.\n        normals (FloatTensor, optional): Tensor of shape (N, num_samples, 3) with normal vectors.\n        textures (FloatTensor, optional): Tensor of shape (N, num_samples, C) with texture vectors.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sample points from the meshes\n    samples, normals, textures = pytorch3d_sample_points(\n        meshes, num_samples, return_normals=return_normals, return_textures=return_textures\n    )\n\n    # Handle empty meshes by filling with zeros\n    if samples is None:\n        samples = torch.zeros((len(meshes), num_samples, 3), dtype=torch.float32)\n    if return_normals and normals is None:\n        normals = torch.zeros((len(meshes), num_samples, 3), dtype=torch.float32)\n    if return_textures and textures is None:\n        textures = torch.zeros((len(meshes), num_samples, textures.shape[-1]), dtype=torch.float32)\n\n    return samples, normals, textures\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Imports**: The function uses PyTorch and PyTorch3D. Ensure you have these libraries installed.\n\n2. **Function Signature**: The function takes a `Meshes` object, the number of samples, and two boolean flags indicating whether to return normals and textures.\n\n3. **Sampling Points**: The function uses `pytorch3d_sample_points` from PyTorch3D to sample points from the mesh surfaces. This function handles the sampling based on face areas.\n\n4. **Handling Empty Meshes**: If any mesh is empty, the function fills the corresponding rows in the output tensors with zeros.\n\n5. **Return Values**: The function returns a tuple containing the sampled points, normals (if requested), and textures (if requested).\n\nThis implementation assumes you have PyTorch3D installed and that you are familiar with its `Meshes` data structure. Adjust the function as needed based on your specific requirements and environment.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called sample_points_from_meshes that converts a batch of meshes to a batch of point clouds by uniformly sampling points on the surface of the mesh with probability proportional to the face area. The function takes in the following arguments:\n- meshes: A Meshes object with a batch of N meshes.\n- num_samples: An integer specifying the number of point samples per mesh.\n- return_normals: A boolean indicating whether to return normals for the sampled points.\n- return_textures: A boolean indicating whether to return textures for the sampled points.\n\nThe function returns a 3-element tuple containing:\n- samples: FloatTensor of shape (N, num_samples, 3) giving the coordinates of sampled points for each mesh in the batch. For empty meshes, the corresponding row in the samples array will be filled with 0.\n- normals: FloatTensor of shape (N, num_samples, 3) giving a normal vector to each sampled point. Only returned if return_normals is True. For empty meshes, the corresponding row in the normals array will be filled with 0.\n- textures: FloatTensor of shape (N, num_samples, C) giving a C-dimensional texture vector to each sampled point. Only returned if return_textures is True. For empty meshes, the corresponding row in the textures array will be filled with 0.\n\nNote that in future releases, the output will be replaced with a `Pointclouds` data structure.",
