    "result": "Certainly! Below is a Python function `camera_position_from_spherical_angles` that calculates the camera's position based on the specified distance, elevation, and azimuth angles. The function uses PyTorch for tensor operations and supports both degrees and radians for angle measurements. It also handles broadcasting of input arguments to ensure they have the correct shape for calculations.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import Tensor\nfrom typing import Union\n\ndef camera_position_from_spherical_angles(\n    distance: float,\n    elevation: float,\n    azimuth: float,\n    degrees: bool = True,\n    device: Union[str, torch.device] = \"cpu\"\n) -> Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the camera position in 3D space based on spherical angles.\n\n    Args:\n        distance (float): Distance from the target point.\n        elevation (float): Elevation angle from the horizontal plane.\n        azimuth (float): Azimuth angle from the reference direction.\n        degrees (bool): If True, angles are in degrees.

    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called camera_position_from_spherical_angles that calculates the location of the camera based on the distance away from the target point, the elevation and azimuth angles. The function takes in parameters distance (float), elevation (float), azimuth (float), degrees (bool = True), and device (Device = \"cpu\") and returns a torch.Tensor representing the (N, 3) xyz location of the camera. The angles can be specified in either degrees or radians, and the function handles broadcasting the input arguments to have shape (N, 1) before performing the calculations.",
