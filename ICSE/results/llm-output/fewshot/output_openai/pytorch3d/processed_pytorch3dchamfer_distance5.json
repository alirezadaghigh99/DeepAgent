    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called chamfer_distance that calculates the Chamfer distance between two point clouds x and y. The function takes in various optional parameters such as x_lengths, y_lengths, x_normals, y_normals, weights, batch_reduction, point_reduction, norm, single_directional, and abs_cosine. The function returns a tuple containing the reduced distance between the point clouds in x and y, as well as the reduced cosine distance of normals between the point clouds in x and y.",
