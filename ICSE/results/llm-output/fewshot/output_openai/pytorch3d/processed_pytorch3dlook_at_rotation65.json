    "result": "To create the `look_at_rotation` function as described, we need to handle input vectors that can be either tuples/lists or PyTorch tensors, normalize these vectors, compute the axes for the rotation matrix, and handle edge cases where the x-axis is close to zero. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef look_at_rotation(camera_position, at, up, device='cpu'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a batched rotation matrix representing the transformation from world coordinates to view coordinates.\n\n    Args:\n        camera_position: 3-element tuple/list or torch tensor of shape (1, 3) or (N, 3).\n        at: 3-element tuple/list or torch tensor of shape (1, 3) or (N, 3).\n        up: 3-element tuple/list or torch tensor of shape (1, 3) or (N, 3).\n        device: The device type ('cpu' or 'cuda').\n\n    Returns:\n        R: Batched rotation matrix of shape (N, 3, 3).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert inputs to tensors if they are not already\n    if not isinstance(camera_position, torch.Tensor):\n        camera_position = torch.tensor(camera_position, dtype=torch.float32, device=device)\n    if not isinstance(at, torch.Tensor):\n        at = torch.tensor(at, dtype=torch.float32, device=device)\n    if not isinstance(up, torch.Tensor):\n        up = torch.tensor(up, dtype=torch.float32, device=device)\n\n    # Ensure inputs are batched\n    if camera_position.dim() == 1:\n        camera_position = camera_position.unsqueeze(0)\n    if at.dim() == 1:\n        at = at.unsqueeze(0)\n    if up.dim() == 1:\n        up = up.unsqueeze(0)\n\n    # Calculate the z-axis\n    z_axis = at - camera_position\n    z_axis = z_axis / torch.norm(z_axis, dim=1, keepdim=True)\n\n    # Calculate the x-axis\n    x_axis = torch.cross(up, z_axis)\n    x_axis_norm = torch.norm(x_axis, dim=1, keepdim=True)\n    # Handle cases where x-axis is close to zero\n    x_axis[x_axis_norm < 1e-6] = torch.tensor([1.0, 0.0, 0.0], device=device)\n    x_axis = x_axis / torch.norm(x_axis, dim=1, keepdim=True)\n\n    # Calculate the y-axis\n    y_axis = torch.cross(z_axis, x_axis)\n    y_axis = y_axis / torch.norm(y_axis, dim=1, keepdim=True)\n\n    # Concatenate axes to form the rotation matrix\n    R = torch.stack((x_axis, y_axis, z_axis), dim=-1)\n\n    # Return the transposed matrix\n    return R.transpose(1, 2)\n\n# Example usage:\ncamera_position = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\nat = [0.0, 0.0, -1.0]\nup = [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]\nR = look_at_rotation(camera_position, at, up)\nprint(R)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Handling**: The function first checks if the inputs are tensors. If not, it converts them to tensors. It also ensures that the inputs are batched by adding an extra dimension if necessary.\n- **Normalization**: The function normalizes the `z_axis`, `x_axis`, and `y_axis` to ensure they are unit vectors.\n- **Cross Product**: The `x_axis` is computed as the cross product of the `up` vector and the `z_axis`. The `y_axis` is computed as the cross product of the `z_axis` and the `x_axis`.\n- **Edge Case Handling**: If the `x_axis` is close to zero, it is set to a default value to avoid numerical instability.\n- **Matrix Construction**: The axes are concatenated to form the rotation matrix, which is then transposed to match the desired output format.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called look_at_rotation that takes in the camera_position, at, up vectors, and device type as inputs. The function returns a batched rotation matrix R representing the transformation from world coordinates to view coordinates. The camera_position, at, and up vectors can be 3-element tuples/lists or torch tensors of shape (1, 3) or (N, 3), where N is the batch size. The function normalizes the input vectors, calculates the x, y, and z axes, and handles cases where the x-axis is close to zero. Finally, it concatenates the axes to form the rotation matrix R and returns the transposed matrix.",
