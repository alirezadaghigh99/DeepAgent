If it is, it returns a tensor with a value of 0.0.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Meshes**: The function iterates over each mesh in the batch.\n\n3. **Edge Length Calculation**: For each mesh, it calculates the lengths of the edges using `mesh.edge_lengths_packed()`.\n\n4. **Weight Calculation**: The weight for each edge is calculated as the inverse of the number of edges in the mesh.\n\n5. **Loss Calculation**: The loss for each edge is calculated as the squared difference between the edge length and the target length, multiplied by the edge weight.\n\n6. **Summing Losses**: The total loss is accumulated across all meshes.\n\n7. **Average Loss**: Finally, the total loss is divided by the number of meshes to get the average loss across the batch.\n\nThis function assumes that you are using the PyTorch3D library, which provides the `Meshes` class and related methods. Make sure to have PyTorch3D installed in your environment to use this function.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called mesh_edge_loss that computes the mesh edge length regularization loss averaged across all meshes in a batch. The function takes in two arguments: meshes (a Meshes object with a batch of meshes) and target_length (a float representing the resting value for the edge length). \n\nThe function calculates the average loss across the batch, where each mesh contributes equally to the final loss, regardless of the number of edges per mesh. Each mesh is weighted with the inverse number of edges, so that meshes with fewer edges have a higher impact on the final loss.\n\nIf the input meshes object is empty, the function returns a tensor with a value of 0.0. Otherwise, the function computes the loss by determining the weight for each edge based on the number of edges in the corresponding mesh. The loss is calculated as the squared difference between the edge length and the target length, multiplied by the weights. \n\nFinally, the function returns the sum of the weighted losses divided by the total number of meshes in the batch.",
