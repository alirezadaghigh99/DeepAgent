    "result": "To implement the `transform_points` method for the `Transform3d` class, we need to handle both 2D and 3D point formats, apply a homogeneous transformation, and ensure numerical stability by clamping the homogeneous coordinate if an `eps` value is provided. Here's how you can implement this method:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: str = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self.device = device\n        self.dtype = dtype\n        if matrix is None:\n            self._matrix = torch.eye(4, dtype=dtype, device=device)\n        else:\n            self._matrix = matrix.to(dtype=dtype, device=device)\n        self._transforms = []\n\n    def transform_points(self, points: torch.Tensor, eps: Optional[float] = None) -> torch.Tensor:\n        \"\"\"\n        Transforms a set of 3D points using the transformation matrix.\n\n        Args:\n            points (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape (P, 3) or (N, P, 3).\n            eps (float, optional): Small value to clamp the homogeneous coordinate.\n\n        Returns:\n            torch.Tensor: Transformed points of the same shape as input.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Check the input dimensions\n        if points.dim() not in {2, 3} or points.size(-1) != 3:\n            raise ValueError(\"Points should be of shape (P, 3) or (N, P, 3).\")\n\n        # Add a homogeneous coordinate\n        ones = torch.ones(*points.shape[:-1], 1, dtype=points.dtype, device=points.device)\n        points_homogeneous = torch.cat([points, ones], dim=-1)\n\n        # Apply the transformation matrix\n        if points.dim() == 2:\n            # (P, 3) -> (P, 4)\n            transformed_points = points_homogeneous @ self._matrix.T\n        else:\n            # (N, P, 3) -> (N, P, 4)\n            transformed_points = torch.bmm(points_homogeneous, self._matrix.transpose(0, 1).expand(points.size(0), -1, -1))\n\n        # Normalize by the homogeneous coordinate\n        w = transformed_points[..., -1:]\n        if eps is not None:\n            w = torch.clamp(w, min=eps)\n        transformed_points = transformed_points[..., :-1] / w\n\n        return transformed_points\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method initializes the transformation matrix to the identity matrix if no matrix is provided. It also sets the device and dtype for the matrix.\n\n2. **Input Validation**: The `transform_points` method checks that the input points are either 2D or 3D with the last dimension being 3.\n\n3. **Homogeneous Coordinates**: A column of ones is appended to the points to convert them to homogeneous coordinates.\n\n4. **Matrix Multiplication**: The transformation matrix is applied using matrix multiplication. For 2D points, a simple matrix multiplication is used. For 3D points, batched matrix multiplication (`torch.bmm`) is used.\n\n5. **Normalization**: The points are normalized by dividing by the homogeneous coordinate. If `eps` is provided, the homogeneous coordinate is clamped to avoid division by zero.\n\nThis implementation should handle both 2D and 3D point transformations efficiently and robustly.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python method `transform_points` for the `Transform3d` class that transforms a set of 3D points using the transformation matrix. The method should handle points in either 2D (P, 3) or 3D (N, P, 3) format, where P is the number of points and N is the batch size. It should perform a homogeneous transformation, adding a fourth coordinate to the points, applying the transformation matrix using batched matrix multiplication, and then dividing by the homogeneous coordinate. If an optional `eps` argument is provided, it should clamp the homogeneous coordinate to avoid division by zero.\n\nClass structure:\n\n```python\nclass Transform3d:\n    def __init__(self, dtype: torch.dtype = torch.float32, device: Device = \"cpu\", matrix: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None):\n        self._matrix = ...\n        self._transforms = []\n        self.device = ...\n        self.dtype = ...\n\n    def transform_points(self, points, eps: Optional[float] = None) -> torch.Tensor:\n        # Implement the function as described in the prompt\n```",
