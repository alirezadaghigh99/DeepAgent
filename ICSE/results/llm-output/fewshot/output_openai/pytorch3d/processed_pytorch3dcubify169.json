Voxels with occupancy probabilities above the threshold are considered occupied.\n\n2. **Cubify**: The `cubify` function from PyTorch3D is used to convert the binary occupancy grid into a mesh. This function handles the creation of vertices and faces, merging shared vertices, and removing internal faces.\n\n3. **Device Management**: The voxel data and optional features are moved to the specified device to ensure compatibility with the rest of the PyTorch3D operations.\n\n4. **Feature Handling**: If color or other features are provided, they are attached to the mesh as vertex features. This step assumes that the features are compatible with the mesh structure.\n\n5. **Alignment**: The `align` parameter determines how the vertices of the cubes are aligned with the voxel grid. The options are \"topleft\", \"corner\", or \"center\", which affect the positioning of the cubes relative to the voxel grid.\n\nThis function provides a flexible way to convert voxel data into a mesh representation, suitable for visualization or further processing in 3D deep learning tasks.",
    "prompt": "Create a Python function called cubify that takes in the following parameters:\n- voxels: a torch.Tensor of shape (N, D, H, W) containing occupancy probabilities\n- thresh: a scalar threshold\n- feats: an optional torch.Tensor of shape (N, K, D, H, W) containing color information\n- device: the device of the output meshes\n- align: a string defining the alignment of the mesh vertices and grid locations\n\nThe function converts a voxel to a mesh by replacing each occupied voxel with a cube consisting of 12 faces and 8 vertices. Shared vertices are merged, and internal faces are removed. The alignment between the vertices of the cubified mesh and the voxel locations is defined by the choice of align, which can be \"topleft\", \"corner\", or \"center\".\n\nThe function returns a Meshes object of the corresponding meshes.",
