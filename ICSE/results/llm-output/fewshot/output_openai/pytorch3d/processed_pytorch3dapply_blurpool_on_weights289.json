    "result": "To create the `apply_blurpool_on_weights` function, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Padding**: Add padding to the weights tensor to ensure that the pooling operation can be applied correctly.\n2. **Max Pooling**: Apply a 2-tap max filter to the padded weights.\n3. **Blur Filter**: Apply a 2-tap blur filter using linear interpolation to smooth the weights.\n4. **Output**: Return the blurred weights tensor with the same shape as the input.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function in Python using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\ndef apply_blurpool_on_weights(weights: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Apply a 2-tap max filter followed by a 2-tap blur filter on the weights tensor.\n\n    Args:\n        weights (Tensor): Input tensor of shape (..., dim).\n\n    Returns:\n        blured_weights (Tensor): Output tensor of the same shape as input with blurred weights.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure weights is a float tensor for operations\n    weights = weights.float()\n\n    # Step 1: Padding\n    # Pad the last dimension with 1 on each side\n    pad = (1, 1)\n    padded_weights = F.pad(weights, pad, mode='replicate')\n\n    # Step 2: Max Pooling\n    # Apply a 2-tap max filter\n    max_pooled_weights = F.max_pool1d(padded_weights.unsqueeze(1), kernel_size=2, stride=1).squeeze(1)\n\n    # Step 3: Blur Filter\n    # Apply a 2-tap blur filter using linear interpolation\n    # Create a simple blur kernel\n    blur_kernel = torch.tensor([0.5, 0.5], device=weights.device).view(1, 1, -1)\n    # Apply the blur filter\n    blurred_weights = F.conv1d(max_pooled_weights.unsqueeze(1), blur_kernel, padding=0).squeeze(1)\n\n    # Step 4: Return the blurred weights\n    return blurred_weights\n\n# Example usage\nweights = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]])\nblurred_weights = apply_blurpool_on_weights(weights)\nprint(blurred_weights)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Padding**: We use `F.pad` with `mode='replicate'` to pad the weights tensor. This ensures that the edges are handled correctly during pooling.\n- **Max Pooling**: We use `F.max_pool1d` to apply a 2-tap max filter. The `unsqueeze` and `squeeze` operations are used to handle the dimensions correctly.\n- **Blur Filter**: We use `F.conv1d` with a simple blur kernel `[0.5, 0.5]` to perform linear interpolation and smooth the weights.\n- **Output**: The function returns the blurred weights tensor with the same shape as the input.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called apply_blurpool_on_weights that filters weights with a 2-tap max filter followed by a 2-tap blur filter, producing a wide and smooth upper envelope on the weights. The input is a tensor called weights of shape `(..., dim)` and the output is a tensor called blured_weights of the same shape `(..., dim)`. The function pads the weights, applies max pooling, and then performs linear interpolation to create the blurred weights.",
