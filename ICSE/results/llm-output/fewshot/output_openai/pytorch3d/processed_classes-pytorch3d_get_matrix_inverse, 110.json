    "result": "To implement the `_get_matrix_inverse` function for the `Rotate` class, you need to compute the inverse of the `_matrix` attribute, which is a batch of 4x4 matrices. Since the `_matrix` attribute contains 3D rotation matrices in the top-left 3x3 submatrix and an identity matrix in the bottom row and rightmost column, the inverse can be computed by transposing the 3x3 rotation matrices and adjusting the translation part accordingly. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\n    def _get_matrix_inverse(self) -> torch.Tensor:\n        \"\"\"\n        Returns the inverse of the _matrix attribute, which is a batch of 4x4 matrices.\n        The inverse of a rotation matrix is its transpose.\n\n        Returns:\n            torch.Tensor: The inverse of the _matrix attribute.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Extract the 3x3 rotation part of the matrix\n        R = self._matrix[:, :3, :3]\n        \n        # Transpose the rotation matrices to get their inverses\n        R_inv = R.transpose(-1, -2)\n        \n        # Create an identity matrix for the 4x4 inverse matrix\n        mat_inv = torch.eye(4, dtype=self._matrix.dtype, device=self._matrix.device)\n        mat_inv = mat_inv.view(1, 4, 4).repeat(R_inv.shape[0], 1, 1)\n        \n        # Set the top-left 3x3 part to the transposed rotation matrices\n        mat_inv[:, :3, :3] = R_inv\n        \n        # The translation part remains zero, so no need to modify it\n        \n        return mat_inv\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Rotation Matrix Inversion**: The inverse of a rotation matrix is its transpose. This is because rotation matrices are orthogonal.\n- **Batch Processing**: The function handles a batch of matrices, so operations are performed in a batch-wise manner.\n- **4x4 Matrix Structure**: The `_matrix` attribute is a 4x4 matrix where the top-left 3x3 submatrix is the rotation matrix, and the last row and column are for homogeneous coordinates (identity matrix for no translation).\n- **Identity Matrix**: The inverse matrix is initialized as an identity matrix, and the top-left 3x3 submatrix is replaced with the transposed rotation matrices. The rest of the matrix remains unchanged, as it represents no translation.",
