    "result": "To define a Python function called `mesh_normal_consistency` that computes the normal consistency of each mesh in a batch of meshes, we can use the PyTorch3D library, which provides tools for working with 3D data, including meshes. The function will calculate the normal consistency based on the angles between the normals of neighboring faces in the meshes. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom pytorch3d.structures import Meshes\n\ndef mesh_normal_consistency(meshes: Meshes) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the average normal consistency of each mesh in a batch of meshes.\n\n    Args:\n        meshes (Meshes): A batch of meshes.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The average normal consistency across the batch.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(meshes) == 0 or all(len(mesh.faces_list()[i]) == 0 for i in range(len(meshes))):\n        return 0.0\n\n    total_consistency = 0.0\n    total_edges = 0\n\n    for mesh in meshes:\n        verts = mesh.verts_packed()\n        faces = mesh.faces_packed()\n\n        # Compute face normals\n        face_normals = torch.cross(\n            verts[faces[:, 1]] - verts[faces[:, 0]],\n            verts[faces[:, 2]] - verts[faces[:, 0]],\n            dim=1\n        )\n        face_normals = face_normals / face_normals.norm(dim=1, keepdim=True)\n\n        # Find all unique edges\n        edges = torch.cat([faces[:, [0, 1]], faces[:, [1, 2]], faces[:, [2, 0]]], dim=0)\n        edges = torch.sort(edges, dim=1)[0]\n        unique_edges, inverse_indices = torch.unique(edges, return_inverse=True, dim=0)\n\n        # Map edges to faces\n        edge_to_faces = [[] for _ in range(len(unique_edges))]\n        for i, edge_idx in enumerate(inverse_indices):\n            edge_to_faces[edge_idx].append(i // 3)\n\n        # Calculate normal consistency for each edge\n        for face_indices in edge_to_faces:\n            if len(face_indices) < 2:\n                continue\n            normal1 = face_normals[face_indices[0]]\n            for j in range(1, len(face_indices)):\n                normal2 = face_normals[face_indices[j]]\n                angle_cos = torch.dot(normal1, normal2).clamp(-1.0, 1.0)\n                total_consistency += angle_cos\n                total_edges += 1\n\n    if total_edges == 0:\n        return 0.0\n\n    return total_consistency / total_edges\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Check**: The function first checks if the input `meshes` object contains any meshes or if all meshes are empty. If so, it returns 0.0.\n\n2. **Face Normals Calculation**: For each mesh, the function calculates the normals of the faces using the cross product of two edges of each face.\n\n3. **Unique Edges**: It identifies all unique edges in the mesh by considering each face's edges and sorting them to ensure uniqueness.\n\n4. **Edge to Face Mapping**: The function maps each unique edge to the faces that share it.\n\n5. **Normal Consistency Calculation**: For each edge shared by multiple faces, it calculates the cosine of the angle between the normals of the faces sharing the edge. This value is accumulated to compute the total normal consistency.\n\n6. **Average Consistency**: Finally, the function returns the average normal consistency across all edges in the batch of meshes. If no edges are found, it returns 0.0.",
    "prompt": "Define a Python function called mesh_normal_consistency that computes the normal consistency of each mesh in a batch of meshes. The function takes a Meshes object as input and returns the average normal consistency across the batch. If the input meshes contain no meshes or all empty meshes, the function returns 0. The normal consistency is calculated based on the angles between the normals of neighboring faces in the meshes. The function handles cases where multiple faces share an edge and efficiently finds the vertices associated with each edge.",
