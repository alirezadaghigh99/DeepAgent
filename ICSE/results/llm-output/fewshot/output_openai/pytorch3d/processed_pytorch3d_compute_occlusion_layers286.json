    "result": "To generate the `_compute_occlusion_layers` function, we need to consider how to determine the occlusion layers for each splatting pixel based on the depth information provided by the `q_depth` tensor. The function will analyze the depth of each pixel and its surrounding pixels to classify the occlusion status in nine possible directions. Here's a possible implementation:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef _compute_occlusion_layers(q_depth: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute occlusion layers for each splatting pixel based on depth information.\n\n    Args:\n        q_depth (Tensor): A tensor of shape (N, H, W) representing the depth of each pixel.\n\n    Returns:\n        occlusion_layers (Tensor): A tensor of shape (N, H, W, 9) indicating occlusion status\n                                   for each of the nine splatting directions.\n    \"\"\"\n    N, H, W = q_depth.shape\n    occlusion_layers = torch.zeros((N, H, W, 9), dtype=torch.int8)\n\n    # Define the relative positions for the 9 splatting directions\n    directions = [\n        (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1),\n        (0, -1), (0, 0), (0, 1),\n        (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)\n    ]\n\n    # Iterate over each direction\n    for idx, (dy, dx) in enumerate(directions):\n        # Shift the depth tensor according to the current direction\n        shifted_depth = torch.roll(q_depth, shifts=(dy, dx), dims=(1, 2))\n\n        # Determine occlusion status\n        # 0: same surface level\n        # -1: background (occluded by another splat above it)\n        # 1: foreground\n        occlusion_layers[..., idx] = torch.where(\n            q_depth == shifted_depth, 0,  # same surface level\n            torch.where(q_depth < shifted_depth, -1, 1)  # background or foreground\n        )\n\n    return occlusion_layers\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input and Output**:\n   - The function takes a tensor `q_depth` of shape `(N, H, W)`, where `N` is the batch size, `H` is the height, and `W` is the width of the depth map.\n   - It returns a tensor `occlusion_layers` of shape `(N, H, W, 9)`, where each of the 9 values corresponds to one of the nine splatting directions.\n\n2. **Directions**:\n   - The nine directions are defined relative to each pixel, including the pixel itself (0, 0) and its eight neighbors.\n\n3. **Occlusion Calculation**:\n   - For each direction, the depth tensor is shifted using `torch.roll` to align the neighboring pixels with the current pixel.\n   - The occlusion status is determined by comparing the depth of the current pixel with the shifted depth:\n     - `0` indicates the same surface level.\n     - `-1` indicates the current pixel is in the background (occluded by another splat above it).\n     - `1` indicates the current pixel is in the foreground.\n\nThis function provides a basic framework for computing occlusion layers based on depth information. Depending on the specific requirements and characteristics of your data, you might need to adjust the logic or add additional processing steps.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called `_compute_occlusion_layers` that takes a tensor `q_depth` as input. The function calculates occlusion layers for each splatting pixel, determining whether it splats from a background, surface, or foreground depth relative to the splatted pixel. The output is a tensor `occlusion_layers` with shape (N, H, W, 9), where each of the 9 values corresponds to one of the nine splatting directions. The values in the tensor indicate whether the splat is on the same surface level as the pixel, in the background (occluded by another splat above it), or in the foreground.",
