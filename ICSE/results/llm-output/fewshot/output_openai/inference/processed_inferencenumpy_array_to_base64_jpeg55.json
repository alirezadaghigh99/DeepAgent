    "result": "To create a Python function that converts a NumPy array representing an image into a Base64-encoded JPEG string, you can use the `cv2` module from OpenCV to encode the image as a JPEG, and the `base64` module to encode the JPEG bytes into a Base64 string. Here's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nimport base64\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef numpy_array_to_base64_jpeg(image: np.ndarray) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a NumPy array representing an image into a Base64-encoded JPEG string.\n\n    Args:\n        image (np.ndarray): A NumPy array representing the image. The array should have a shape\n                            compatible with OpenCV's image encoding, such as (H, W, 3) for a color\n                            image or (H, W) for a grayscale image.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A Base64-encoded string of the JPEG image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Encode the image as a JPEG\n    success, encoded_image = cv2.imencode('.jpg', image)\n    if not success:\n        raise ValueError(\"Image encoding failed.\")\n\n    # Convert the encoded image to a Base64 string\n    base64_string = base64.b64encode(encoded_image).decode('utf-8')\n\n    return base64_string\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Importing Modules**: The function imports `cv2` for image encoding, `base64` for Base64 encoding, and `numpy` for handling the image array.\n\n2. **Function Definition**: The function `numpy_array_to_base64_jpeg` takes a NumPy array `image` as input.\n\n3. **JPEG Encoding**: The function uses `cv2.imencode` to encode the image as a JPEG. This function returns a success flag and the encoded image. If encoding fails, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\n4. **Base64 Encoding**: The encoded JPEG image is then converted to a Base64 string using `base64.b64encode`, and the result is decoded to a UTF-8 string.\n\n5. **Return**: The function returns the Base64-encoded JPEG string.\n\nThis function can be used to convert images stored as NumPy arrays into a format suitable for embedding in web pages or transmitting over text-based protocols.",
