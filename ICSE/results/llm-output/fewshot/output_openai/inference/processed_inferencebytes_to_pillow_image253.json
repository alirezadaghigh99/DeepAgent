    "result": "Certainly! Below is a Python function named `bytes_to_pillow_image` that takes a `bytes` object called `payload` as input and returns a Pillow `Image` object. It uses `BytesIO` to read the bytes data and attempts to open it as an image using `Image.open`. If the image format is not recognized, it raises an `EncodingError` with the specified message.\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom io import BytesIO\n\nclass EncodingError(Exception):\n    \"\"\"Custom exception for encoding errors.\"\"\"\n    pass\n\ndef bytes_to_pillow_image(payload: bytes) -> Image.Image:\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert a bytes object to a Pillow Image object.\n\n    Args:\n        payload (bytes): The bytes object containing image data.\n\n    Returns:\n        Image.Image: A Pillow Image object.\n\n    Raises:\n        EncodingError: If the bytes cannot be decoded into a valid image.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        with BytesIO(payload) as byte_stream:\n            image = Image.open(byte_stream)\n            image.load()  # Ensure the image is fully loaded\n            return image\n    except (IOError, ValueError) as e:\n        raise EncodingError(\"Could not encode bytes to PIL image.\") from e\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Imports**: The function imports `Image` from the Pillow library and `BytesIO` from the `io` module.\n- **Custom Exception**: A custom exception `EncodingError` is defined to handle cases where the bytes cannot be decoded into a valid image.\n- **Function Logic**:\n  - The function takes a `bytes` object `payload` as input.\n  - It uses `BytesIO` to create an in-memory stream from the bytes.\n  - `Image.open` is used to attempt to open the stream as an image.\n  - If successful, the image is fully loaded using `image.load()`.\n  - If the image format is not recognized, an `EncodingError` is raised with the specified message.",
