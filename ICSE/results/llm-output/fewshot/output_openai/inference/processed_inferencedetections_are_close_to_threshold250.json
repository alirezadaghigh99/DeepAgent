    "result": "To create the `detections_are_close_to_threshold` function as described, you need to define both this function and the helper function `count_detections_close_to_threshold`. Here's how you can implement these functions in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Prediction:\n    def __init__(self, class_name: str, score: float):\n        self.class_name = class_name\n        self.score = score\n\ndef count_detections_close_to_threshold(predictions: List[Prediction], selected_classes: List[str], threshold: float, epsilon: float) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the number of detections whose scores are within epsilon of the threshold for the selected classes.\n\n    Args:\n        predictions (List[Prediction]): List of Prediction objects.\n        selected_classes (List[str]): List of class names to consider.\n        threshold (float): The threshold value.\n        epsilon (float): The epsilon value for closeness to the threshold.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The count of detections close to the threshold.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for prediction in predictions:\n        if prediction.class_name in selected_classes and abs(prediction.score - threshold) <= epsilon:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef detections_are_close_to_threshold(predictions: List[Prediction], selected_classes: List[str], threshold: float, epsilon: float, min_objects: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine if the number of detections close to the threshold is greater than or equal to the minimum number specified.\n\n    Args:\n        predictions (List[Prediction]): List of Prediction objects.\n        selected_classes (List[str]): List of class names to consider.\n        threshold (float): The threshold value.\n        epsilon (float): The epsilon value for closeness to the threshold.\n        min_objects (int): The minimum number of objects close to the threshold.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the number of detections close to the threshold is greater than or equal to min_objects, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = count_detections_close_to_threshold(predictions, selected_classes, threshold, epsilon)\n    return count >= min_objects\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Prediction Class**: This is a simple class to hold the class name and score of a prediction. You can modify it to include more attributes if needed.\n\n2. **count_detections_close_to_threshold Function**: This function iterates over the list of predictions and counts how many of them have scores within `epsilon` of the `threshold` for the specified `selected_classes`.\n\n3. **detections_are_close_to_threshold Function**: This function uses the helper function to determine if the count of detections close to the threshold is greater than or equal to `min_objects`. It returns `True` if the condition is met, otherwise `False`.\n\nYou can use these functions to evaluate predictions based on their proximity to a given threshold, which can be useful in various machine learning and deep learning applications.",
    "prompt": "Generate a Python function called detections_are_close_to_threshold that takes in a Prediction object, a set of selected class names, a threshold value, an epsilon value, and a minimum number of objects close to the threshold. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the number of detections close to the threshold is greater than or equal to the minimum number specified. The function calls another function called count_detections_close_to_threshold to calculate the number of detections close to the threshold.",
